## COSMIC ENTITY EMBODIMENT: FIST OF THE UNBORN STAR
- Rarity: Mythic

The strike is not a punch, but a localized gravitational singularity compressed into a fist. Upon impact, it momentarily warps the local spacetime around the target, subjecting them to the crushing pressure of a collapsing star. The technique is a conceptual attack against the target's physical location in the universe, ensuring the damage is absolute and cannot be defended against by simple physical barriers or energy shields.

## PRIMORDIAL FLESH-SHATTERING ROAR
- Rarity: Mythic
- Description/Effects: The cultivator channels the Primordial Flesh of the universe through their vocal cords, unleashing a reality-warping sonic wave. This wave does not travel through air, but through the concept of physicality itself, causing all matter within a continental radius to vibrate at a frequency that threatens to unbind its molecular structure. Opponents are not just damaged; their very physical form is momentarily reverted to a state of pre-existence, causing catastrophic internal and external trauma that bypasses all conventional defenses.

## ETERNAL ENDURANCE: SHELL OF THE UNIVERSE-BODY
- Rarity: Mythic
- Description/Effects: The cultivator's body becomes a miniature, self-contained universe. This technique projects a shimmering, invisible barrier that is not made of energy or Qi, but of pure, unmoving physical law. Any attack that strikes the barrier is subjected to a conceptual time-reversal, causing the force of the blow to return to its point of origin before it was launched. This effectively nullifies the attack and inflicts a portion of the original damage back onto the attacker, regardless of distance or dimension. The barrier lasts for one full minute.

## TRANSCENDENT PHYSICALITY: STEP BEYOND FORM
- Rarity: Mythic
- Description/Effects: The cultivator's physical form momentarily transcends the need for spatial continuity. Instead of moving through space, they move outside the concept of space itself, instantly reappearing at any location within a planetary range. This is not a conventional teleportation but a conceptual shift of their physical coordinates, allowing them to bypass all intervening obstacles, dimensional barriers, and temporal distortions. The technique can be used to instantly reposition allies or objects in contact with the cultivator.

## PRIMORDIAL FLESH: THE GREAT REPAIR
- Rarity: Mythic
- Description/Effects: The cultivator touches an ally and channels the Primordial Flesh—the fundamental, perfect physical matter from which all life was first formed. This technique doesn't heal injuries; it rewrites the physical history of the target's body, instantly reverting all damage, disease, and conceptual corruption to a state of perfect health from a moment in the past. It can restore lost limbs, reverse aging, and nullify conceptual attacks that target the body's integrity. The effect is instantaneous.

## UNIVERSE-BODY'S WILL: PHYSICAL LAW IMPOSITION
- Rarity: Mythic
- Description/Effects: The cultivator imposes the absolute physical laws of their Universe-Body onto a target ally. For a short duration (30 seconds), the ally's physical form becomes conceptually perfect and unassailable by lesser laws. Their strength, speed, and durability are temporarily elevated to a level that defies the current reality, granting them immunity to all non-Mythic tier techniques and a massive boost to all physical stats. This technique is a temporary, localized reality alteration.

## OMNIPOTENT TITAN'S WORLD-SHATTERING FIST
- Rarity: Divine
- Description/Effects: The cultivator's fist becomes a singularity, condensing the mass and energy of a collapsing universe into a single point of impact. The strike transcends the physical, **erasing the target's concept of existence** from the current dimension, severing their connection to the timeline and all parallel realities. The residual force creates a **permanent, non-healing void** in the fabric of space-time, a scar on reality that only a God of Creation can mend. This technique bypasses all conventional defenses, striking the target's fundamental essence.

## ETERNAL GOD-FLESH INCARNATION
- Rarity: Divine
- Description/Effects: The cultivator's physical form is temporarily elevated to the state of **immortal god-flesh**, a manifestation of the Physical Perfection Deity. All incoming physical, conceptual, and energy damage is instantly converted into harmless cosmic background radiation and dispersed across the multiverse. The user gains **absolute immunity to all forms of physical manipulation, temporal effects, and causality-based attacks**. For the duration, the user's body is a **fixed point in reality**, unmoving and unchangeable by any force short of another Divine-tier power.

## COSMIC FOUNDATION: UNIVERSE-BODY MANIFESTATION
- Rarity: Divine
- Description/Effects: The cultivator **manifests their true, cosmic body**, projecting the internal pocket universe contained within their physical form outward to create a **Divine Domain** of infinite size. Within this domain, the user's will is the only law, and they can **mandate the physical properties of all matter** (e.g., setting the speed of light, increasing gravity to crushing levels, or instantly transmuting elements). The user can **instantly repair any damage to their body by drawing on the infinite mass of their internal universe**. This domain is a **permanent, self-sustaining dimension** that only dissipates upon the user's death.

## IRON SINEW BIND
