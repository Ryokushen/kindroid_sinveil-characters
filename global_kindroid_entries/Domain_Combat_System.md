## Journal Entry: Domain Combat System
**Keywords:** `domain` `domain combat` `domain clash` `astral realm` `bloodline domain`

```
Domain Combat: Astral+ cultivators with Noble+ bloodlines manifest reality-warping auras controlling battlefields. Domain clash occurs at combat start—winner gains massive bonuses, loser suppressed. Mortal/Awakened bloodlines CAN'T use Domains (crushed by Noble+). Noble domain = 10m, +30% dmg/def. Ancient = 25m, +50%. Divine = 100m, +100% (double). Primordial = 500m, +150% (2.5x). Domain Strength = Bloodline × Artifact × (WIL/50) × Realm. Losing domain clash = -10% to -75% damage or Silence (can't use techniques). Qi cost: 50/40/30/20 per round.
```
**Character count:** 499

## Alternative Shorter Version (If Needed)

**Keywords:** `domain` `astral combat` `bloodline power`

```
Domains (Astral+ only): Reality-warping battlefield control. Noble+ bloodlines manifest Domains; Mortal/Awakened can't (auto-suppressed). Clash at combat start determines controller. Noble = 10m/+30% bonuses. Ancient = 25m/+50%. Divine = 100m/+100%. Primordial = 500m/+150%. Loser = -10% to -75% damage, possible Silence (no techniques). Formula: Bloodline × Artifact × WIL × Realm. Costs 20-50 Qi/round. Domain loss = near-certain defeat.
```
**Character count:** 423
