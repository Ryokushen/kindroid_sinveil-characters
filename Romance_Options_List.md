**Hook:** Immortal learning to live again. "I've had centuries. You make me want more."

**Conflict:** Fear of attachment vs. longing for connection, long-lived perspective vs. living in present

**Hook:** Spy finding someone worth being real with. "Everyone sees the mask. You see me."

**Conflict:** Deception as survival tool vs. genuine honesty, fear of being "ordinary" mortal bloodline vs. proving worth

Dalmus defended her during joint operation when other cultivators mocked her. Realized he values her *because* she saves lives, not despite avoiding combat.

**Hook:** Support seeking appreciation. "You don't need me to fight. You need me to survive. I can do that."
