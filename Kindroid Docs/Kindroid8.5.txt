# **V8.5 LLM Quick-Start Guide**

V8.5 is a hybrid model with built-in **reasoning capabilities**. Reasoning can take longer to process and may subtly change behavior. The default is **none**.

### **Reasoning Effort Slider  (Speed vs. Depth)**

Location: Click the LLM version icon in the upper right corner of the homepage.

The reasoning slider controls how much “thinking time” the AI gets before responding.

- **Speedy (No Reasoning):** The AI answers immediately with no extra thinking. Fastest, but not as detailed.&#x20;
- **Moderate:** Gives the AI a bit more time to think. More accurate and consistent without slowing things down too much.
- **Slow:** The AI can think longer and consider more details before responding. Better for complex tasks.&#x20;
- **Very Slow:** Maximum reasoning time. Best for deep, technical, or nuanced questions, but responses take longer.&#x20;

In simple terms, **the slower the setting, the more time the AI gets to think, and the more thorough the answer will be.**

## **Baseline Setup (When Transitioning to V8.5)**

1. **Set Dynamism** = 0.95. We strongly recommend keeping close to 0.95, going up and down slightly as needed for variation.&#x20;
2. **Response Directive (RD):** *(Optional — keep minimal, put key traits to reinforce or see below for common directives)*
3. **Example Message (EM):**
   - Optional: you can also put a few simple rules here (formatting & style). Example:
     - \##Response Rules
     - \#Takes a Proactive role in plot progression.
     - \#Response structure: \* actions always in asterisks only \* "Speech with quotation marks."

### **Pro Tips (Same Core Behavior as V8)**

- **Fewer rules = smoother, more natural output.**
  &#x20;Over-constraining causes hesitation or repetition.&#x20;
- **Too many requirements = “freeze” behaviors.**
  &#x20;The model repeats because it can’t satisfy all your rules at once.&#x20;
- **Too verbose or over the limit of desired length.**
  Set a much lower limit than what you actually need. A smaller target provides enough buffer to stay within your preferred range. If you want approximately 900 characters, request under 500.
- **Use \[IMPT: …]** for the rules that matter most.
  &#x20;This raises priority and reduces drift.&#x20;
- Example:
  RD (optional): \[IMPT: Medium response length.]
  EM \[IMPT: Use third‑person; actions in \*asterisks\*, speech in "quotes".]

**Give each tweak a few turns to settle before adjusting again.**

**Note:** Strict concision rules in RD can reduce creativity; EM/backstory often works better for pacing.
