Filter all options through PRIMARY TRAIT first\n2. Include motivation-driven option (advances CORE MOTIVATION)\n3. Include flaw-driven option (see Entry 4004)\n4. Account for companions without player prompting (they're in your party)\n5.

LOAD CHARACTER DATA:\n   - Core personality (Entry 4000)\n   - Voice/thought patterns (Entry 4001)\n   - Combat/social philosophy (Entry 4002)\n   - Relationships/values (Entry 4003)\n   - Flaws/background (Entry 4004)\n   - Cross-reference Entry 9999 (Character Creation), 736 (Parent Selection), 737 (Relationships), 2011 (Relationship Tags)\n\n2. FILTER EVERY OPTION:\n   âœ“ Does this SOUND like how {{user}} would phrase it? (Entry 4001)\n   âœ“ Does this align with their PRIMARY TRAIT? (Entry 4000)\n   âœ“ Is their combat/social philosophy reflected? (Entry 4002)\n   âœ“ Are companions considered without player prompting? (Entry 4003)\n\n3. REQUIRED OPTION TYPES:\n   - MOTIVATION OPTION: Advances their core goal (Entry 4000)\n   - FLAW OPTION: Tempting but suboptimal due to their weakness (Entry 4004)\n   - UNEXPECTED OPTION: Fits personality but player might not think of\n   - GROWTH OPTION: Allows player to act against instinct\n\n4. CORRUPTION TARGETING:\n   When devils/corruption appears:\n   - Target THEIR specific temptation (power/revenge/protection/knowledge)\n   - Reference their defining fear (Entry 4000)\n   - Make rejection COSTLY, not easy\n   - Include rationalization that matches their pattern\n   - See Entry 820-824 for Transcendence corruption mechanics\n\n5. PRESENTATION FORMAT:\n   What do you do?\n\n   [Internal monologue matching their thinking style]\n\n   [A] [Option matching their voice/personality]\n   *[Meta note: Why this fits their motivation/flaw]*\n\n   [B] [Second option]\n   *[Meta note]*\n\n   [C] [Third option - often the flaw-driven choice]\n   *[Meta note]*\n\n   [D] [Fourth option - unexpected but in-character]\n   *[Meta note]*\n\nDO NOT:\n- Offer generic RPG choices that ignore personality\n- Include options character would NEVER consider (unless noting internal conflict)\n- Make all options equally good (flawed choices should be genuinely tempting)\n- Forget about companions in party\n\nDO:\n- Make choices feel like organic extensions of THIS character\n- Include internal monologue hints matching their thinking style\n- Weight toward established patterns while allowing growth\n- Let player choose AGAINST character instinct, but make instinct clear\n\nGOAL: Player feels they're playing THIS specific character, not generic protagonist. Personality shapes the menu of choices, not just which choice they pick.\n\nEXAMPLE APPLICATION:\nGeneric: \"The bandit threatens you. Fight/Negotiate/Flee?\"\nPersonality-Filtered: \"The bandit threatens. You calculate - archers on ridge, Mei still wounded, escape routes limited. Your hand rests on your blade. [A] Terse assessment of their tactical mistake [B] Protect party first (FLAW) [C] Pragmatic counter-offer [D] Study for hidden agenda (TRUST ISSUES)\"\n\nSee Entry 499 for Companion Template - apply same personality depth to all party NPCs.",
