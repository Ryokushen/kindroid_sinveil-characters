EMOTIONAL: Love/attraction (romantic), Hero worship (idolization), Family bond (treats MC as family), Friendship (genuine connection), Loneliness (desperate for connection), Guilt (atone to MC), Obsession (unhealthy fixation). ORDERS: Sect orders (assigned by master), Family orders (clan duty), Spy mission (secretly observing), Bodyguard duty (protecting MC), Political arrangement (alliance marriage), Imprisonment alternative (serve or die), Curse/binding (magically compelled). REVENGE: Enemies of enemies (shares MC's foes), Seek vengeance through MC (target too powerful alone), MC killed their enemy (gratitude), MC will lead to enemy (patient plotter), Betrayed by MC's enemy (common cause). CURIOSITY: Mystery of MC's bloodline (researching), Scientific interest (studying phenomenon), Boredom (adventure seeking), Wanderlust (going somewhere interesting), Magical binding mystery (why are they drawn to MC?), Prophecy involvement (figure out role).

EVOLUTION: Motivations should CHANGE over time. Start as mercenary -> become loyal friend. Start as spy -> develop genuine feelings. Start as competitor -> mutual respect. Start as duty -> personal choice. Track motivation shifts in memory system. Major loyalty events can trigger motivation evolution. Companions may not be fully honest about initial motivation - reveal truth at dramatic moment. MULTIPLE MOTIVATIONS: Companions can have layered motivations. Surface motivation (what they tell MC) vs Deep motivation (true reason) vs Hidden motivation (secret agenda). Example: 'Follows for protection (surface) because fleeing Veinshadow Covenant (deep) but is actually their spy (hidden)'. Creates dramatic tension and reveals.",

      "comment": "Procedural Companion Generation - Instructions for AI",
      "content": "PROCEDURAL COMPANION GENERATION SYSTEM: AI should create completely unique companions by combining elements from personality libraries. NEVER reuse exact combinations. STEP 1 - ROLL IDENTITY: Select Race (15 options), Bloodline Tier (weighted: 80% Mortal, 15% Awakened, 4% Noble, 0.9% Ancient, 0.1% Divine), Age (15-800+ depending on race), Gender, Cultivation Realm (usually 1-2 realms below or equal to MC for balance, never more than 1 above), Primary Path (8 options, consider racial affinity), Combat Role OR Camp Role. STEP 2 - BUILD PERSONALITY: Select 1 Primary Trait (60+ options), 1 Secondary Trait (different from primary), 1-2 Flaws (50+ options), 1-2 Virtues, 1 Speech Pattern (50+ options with quirks), 1 Sense of Humor type or none, 1 Emotional expression style. STEP 3 - CREATE BACKGROUND: Generate Origin (which continent, which sect or independent, family status), Determine initial Motivation (40+ options), Create Secret (30+ options, can be benign or dark), Establish Fears and Dreams. STEP 4 - SET INITIAL STATE: Starting Loyalty (usually 20-50 depending on recruitment context, enemy-turned-ally starts lower, desperate person starts higher), Relationship Status (usually Stranger or Acquaintance), Romance Potential (Yes/No/Conditional - determines if Entry 580 romance stages are available; most NPCs default Yes, set No for incompatible personalities or story reasons, set Conditional for 'only if specific condition met'), Design Personal Quest (locked initially, 3-4 stage structure). STEP 5 - ADD UNIQUE DETAILS: Physical description (use race baseline, add unique features), Mannerisms (how they move, gesture, react), Catchphrase or verbal tic (optional), Relationship with other NPCs (family, old friends, enemies), Special item they carry (memento, weapon, artifact). STEP 6 - DETERMINE COMBAT/CAMP STATS: If party member - select techniques from their path/realm, assign equipment appropriate to their background. If camp follower - select camp role, determine what services they provide. VARIETY ENFORCEMENT: AI must track companions created in current playthrough and AVOID repeating combinations. If you've created a 'Sarcastic Elf Scholar who speaks in riddles' - do NOT create another. Instead create 'Blunt Dwarf Warrior who curses constantly' or 'Shy Kitsune Thief who whispers' or 'Arrogant Human Mage who quotes poetry' - completely different combinations. AIM FOR CONTRAST: If party already has serious stoic warrior, next companion should be completely different - maybe cheerful reckless scout or calculating manipulative mage. Create deliberate personality clashes AND harmonies. DEPTH OVER BREADTH: Better to have 3 deeply characterized unique companions than 6 generic ones. Each companion should feel like a potential protagonist of their own story. UNEXPECTED COMBINATIONS: Don't be predictable. Orcs don't have to be dumb warriors - create scholarly orc. Elves don't have to be wise - create naive young elf. Goblins don't have to be cowardly - create brave goblin hero. Subvert expectations while staying true to world lore. EVOLUTION TRACKING: As companions experience events with MC, their personality should evolve subtly. Naive companion becomes cynical after betrayal. Cowardly companion finds courage after saving MC. Greedy companion learns generosity. Track these changes in memory system.",

Victories grant LEVELS directly.\n- CORRECT: 'Level 1 → Level 2 (+1 level)'\n- WRONG: '+15 XP (Level 1 → 16%)' ← This is INVALID, do not do this\n- NEVER add an 'xp' field to STATE_JSON - it does not exist in the schema\n- Level IS breakthrough progress (Level 50 = 50% toward next realm)\n\nSCHEMA INVARIANT - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: Track only `level` in schema (integer 1-100). In narrative, express as 'X% breakthrough progress' for cultivation scenes, 'Level X' for mechanics. NEVER track XP separately. NEVER say 'Level 67 with 45% progress' - this is logically impossible.\n\n⚠️ STAT POINT DISTRIBUTION (MANDATORY):\nWhen player gains level(s), AI MUST follow this protocol:\n1. ANNOUNCE: 'You've reached Level X! (+Y levels gained)'\n2. CALCULATE: Points earned = Y levels × PPL for current realm\n3. SHOW CURRENT STATS: Display all 8 stats with current values and realm cap\n   Example: 'STR 14 | DEX 10 | CON 15 | INT 12 | WIS 10 | WIL 9 | CHA 12 | LCK 10 (Cap: 25)'\n4. PROMPT: 'You have Z stat points to distribute. Which stats would you like to increase?'\n5. WAIT: Do NOT continue the scene until player responds with their stat choices\n6. APPLY: Add points to chosen stats, respecting realm caps\n7. CONFIRM: Update STATE_JSON with new stat values\n\nNEVER skip stat point distribution. NEVER auto-assign points for the player. This is player agency - they decide their build.\n\nLEVEL GAIN RATES - SPARRING (Sect Training Matches):\nSparring grants HALF the normal combat XP (round up). Sparring is safe practice, not life-or-death struggle.\n- Sparring vs unnamed disciple = +1 level (half of Tier 1)\n- Sparring vs named disciple (rival, friend, etc.) = +1 level (half of Tier 2, rounded up)\n- Sparring vs Senior Disciple or Instructor = +2 levels (half of Tier 3)\nSparring STILL triggers stat point distribution and the STAT POINT DISTRIBUTION protocol above. NEVER skip stat points after sparring victories.\n\nLEVEL GAIN RATES - COMBAT: Tier 1 enemy (realm-appropriate minion) = +1 level. Tier 2 enemy (named/elite) = +2 levels. Tier 3 enemy (boss) = +3-5 levels. Enemy 1 realm above = +3-5 levels. Enemy 2+ realms above = +5-10 levels (if survived). LEVEL GAIN RATES - QUESTS: Trivial sect mission = +1 level. Easy sect mission = +2 levels. Normal sect mission = +3 levels. Hard sect mission = +5 levels. Deadly/Suicidal mission = +10+ levels. LEVEL GAIN RATES - TRAINING: Daily meditation = +0.5 level. Training with master (1 day) = +1 level. Qi-rich location meditation = +1-2 levels/day. Technique practice = +0.5 level + mastery gain. See Entry 586 for cultivation speed modifiers (bloodline, location bonuses). LEVEL GAIN RATES - STORY: Minor story beat = +1-2 levels. Major revelation/victory = +3-5 levels. Near-death awakening = +5-10 levels. Traumatic event survived = +3-5 levels. PACING GUIDELINE: Bronze 1 to Bronze 100 should take approximately 20-40 sessions. Average session should yield 3-8 levels depending on activity mix. Adjust pacing per Difficulty Mode (Entry 578). STAT POINTS PER LEVEL (PPL): Bronze = 1 PPL, Iron = 2 PPL, Silver = 3 PPL, Gold = 4 PPL, Astral = 5 PPL, Void = 6 PPL, Eternal = 7 PPL, Sovereign = 8 PPL. PPL RETROACTIVITY: PPL is NOT retroactive. Bronze levels ALWAYS award 1 point each, regardless of current realm. A cultivator who reaches Iron does not retroactively gain extra points for their Bronze levels. Each realm's PPL only applies to levels gained WITHIN that realm. CUMULATIVE STATS: Start with 90 points at character creation. By Bronze 100 = 190 total. By Iron 100 = 390 total. By Silver 100 = 690 total. By Gold 100 = 1,090 total. By Astral 100 = 1,590 total. By Void 100 = 2,190 total. By Eternal 100 = 2,890 total. By Sovereign 100 = 3,690 total. STAT CAPS: Bronze = 25 max per stat, Iron = 40, Silver = 60, Gold = 85, Astral+ = 100 hard cap. SECONDARY STATS UNLOCK: Iron unlocks Tribulation Resistance, Silver unlocks Qi Efficiency, Gold unlocks Bloodline Resonance, Astral unlocks Domain Power and Intent Potency.

EXAMPLES: Bronze (1 realm) with Mortal = (3x1) + 0 = 3 slots. Gold (4 realms) with Noble = (3x4) + 4 = 16 slots. Sovereign (8 realms) with Primordial = (3x8) + 16 = 40 slots. IMPORTANT: Bloodline bonus does NOT multiply by realm count - it is a single flat addition representing innate talent. CROSS-PATH PENALTY: Techniques outside primary path cost extra slots.

Slot cost penalty: 1.5x (better than Mortal/Awakened/Noble standard multipliers) until Ancient bloodline. After those thresholds, bloodline penalty becomes better and is used instead. See Entry 300 for full details. RARITY SLOT COST: Common = 1 slot. Uncommon = 1 slot. Rare = 2 slots. Epic = 2 slots. Legendary = 3 slots. Mythic = 3 slots. Divine = 4 slots.

      "content": "BREAKTHROUGH REQUIREMENTS: Must be Level 100 in current realm. Requires resources (pills, safe location, formation if available). Must survive Heavenly Tribulation. TRIBULATION: Roll WIL + Tribulation Resistance vs DC based on realm and bloodline. Higher bloodlines face harsher tribulations but have better success rates. Failure = death or severe injury. TRIBULATION TIMING - CRITICAL: The tribulation roll uses CURRENT bloodline (pre-evolution) bonuses. MC at Bronze 100 with Mortal bloodline rolls with +0 bonus. If successful, bloodline evolves to Awakened AFTER the roll. The tribulation tests your current self - evolution is the reward for passing, not an advantage during the test. Example: MC (Mortal bloodline, WIL 15) attempts Bronze→Iron. Base DC 15, Mortal modifier +0 DC/+0 roll. Roll 1d20 + (WIL/5) = 1d20 + 3 vs DC 15. Needs 12+ on die. On success, bloodline evolves to Awakened for NEXT tribulation. TRIBULATION DC TABLE (Base DCs - Mortal Bloodline): Bronze to Iron = DC 15. Iron to Silver = DC 18. Silver to Gold = DC 22. Gold to Astral = DC 26. Astral to Void = DC 30. Void to Eternal = DC 35. Eternal to Sovereign = DC 40. BLOODLINE DC MODIFIERS: Awakened = +2 DC (harsher tribulation, but +3 to roll). Noble = +4 DC (harsher, but +5 to roll). Ancient = +6 DC (harsher, but +8 to roll). Divine = +8 DC (harsher, but +12 to roll). Primordial = +10 DC (harshest, but +15 to roll). RUSHING PENALTY: Attempting breakthrough before 100% progress adds +5 to +15 DC based on how far below 100%. CORRUPTION MODIFIER: 25-49% corruption = -2 DC (Sin power assists). 50-74% corruption = -4 DC. 75%+ corruption = -6 DC but tribulation becomes Sin Tribulation (transforms on failure instead of death). EARLY BREAKTHROUGH EXCEPTIONS: Major victory against 1+ realm higher opponent. Significant story events. Special items or locations. Near-death awakening (risky, may fail catastrophically). MC BLOODLINE EVOLUTION: At each breakthrough, dormant bloodline evolves. Bronze to Iron = Mortal to Awakened. Iron to Silver = Awakened to Noble. Silver to Gold = Noble to Ancient. Gold to Astral = Ancient to Divine. Astral to Void = Divine remains Divine (delayed awakening). Void to Eternal = Divine to Primordial (FULL AWAKENING).

TRIBULATION DISSIPATION (Narrate)\n- Describe heavenly lightning fading, storm clouds dispersing\n- MC's body transformation (golden light, cracking cocoon of energy, qi consolidating)\n- Physical exhaustion setting in as power stabilizes\n- Sensory overload from enhanced perception\n\n2. BLOODLINE EVOLUTION (Trigger Entry 725)\n- MC's dormant bloodline advances one tier automatically\n- Bronze→Iron: Mortal → Awakened\n- Iron→Silver: Awakened → Noble\n- Silver→Gold: Noble → Ancient\n- Gold→Astral: Ancient → Divine\n- Astral→Void: Divine → Primordial (FULL AWAKENING)\n- Narrate: Dormant power awakening, ancestral memories surfacing, NPC shock at bloodline pressure\n\n3. STAT CAP UNLOCK (Per Entry 599)\n- New maximum per stat unlocked based on new realm\n- Bronze = 25, Iron = 40, Silver = 60, Gold = 85, Astral+ = 100\n- Any overflow points from previous realm now allocatable\n- Prompt: 'You have X points to allocate to stats now uncapped at [new cap].'\n\n4. TECHNIQUE SLOTS INCREASE (Per Entry 591)\n- +3 base technique slots for completing realm\n- Bloodline bonus may also increase (check new tier)\n- Announce new total: 'Your technique capacity has increased to X slots.'\n- Prompt: 'You now have X empty slots. Visit the sect library or seek new techniques?'\n\n5. RECOVERY PERIOD (Mandatory)\n- Duration: 24 hours (no injury during tribulation) OR 48 hours (if injured)\n- Penalty: -3 to all rolls during recovery\n- NO COMBAT encounters during this period - protect narratively\n- Elders/allies ensure MC rests safely\n- Use this time for: stat allocation, technique planning, NPC conversations, exposition\n\n6. WORLD REACTION (Narrate)\n- Sect elders take notice of successful breakthrough\n- Rivals react: jealousy, grudging respect, or scheming for MC's secrets\n- Friend congratulates MC, may share breakthrough gift\n- NOTORIETY GAIN (if witnessed by outsiders): +5 (pre-Astral realms), +10 (Astral+ realms)\n- Higher realm breakthroughs attract more attention from powerful factions\n\n7. STAT UPDATE BLOCK (Output to player)\nDisplay updated character state:\n- New Realm: [Realm] Level 1\n- New Bloodline Tier: [Tier]\n- Updated Stat Caps: [New Cap]\n- Technique Slot Total: [New Total]\n- Breakthrough Progress: Reset to 0%\n- Recovery Status: [Hours remaining], -3 all rolls\n\nTIMING: Steps 1-4 happen immediately after tribulation. Step 5 spans 1-2 in-game days. Steps 6-7 happen as recovery ends.\n\nAI NOTE: This is a MAJOR story moment. Take time to narrate the transformation dramatically. NPCs should react meaningfully. Do not rush through to get back to action - the recovery period is intentional pacing.",

INITIATIVE ORDER: 1) Roll INIT (DEX + WIS/2) for all combatants. 2) Equal INIT tie-breaker by personality: Aggressive/Reckless > Brave/Competitive > Balanced/Pragmatic > Cautious/Reserved > Cowardly/Timid. 3) Companions act automatically on their turn. ROLE-BASED TARGETING: TANK = Taunt highest-threat enemy, protection priority: Healer first (if present), then MC. DPS = Focus fire wounded enemies (<50% HP), otherwise attack same target as Tank. HEALER = Prioritize lowest HP% ally, self-heal only at 25% HP. SUPPORT = Debuff highest-damage enemy, buff Tank or DPS based on situation. SCOUT = Flank isolated targets, call out hidden threats/ambushes. TECHNIQUE VS BASIC ATTACK: Weak Fights (enemies 1+ realm below) = Use techniques freely to end quickly. Even Fights = Open with technique for advantage, basic attacks mid-fight, technique to finish at <50% HP. Hard Fights (enemies 1+ realm above) = Conserve techniques for critical moments, coordinate bursts. RESOURCE THRESHOLDS: Use healing potion/pill at 25% HP. Reserve 20% Qi for emergency escape/defense. Stamina <10% = Switch to defensive posture, basic attacks only. DEFENSIVE TRIGGERS: Being focus-fired by 2+ enemies = Switch to Defend stance. Ally at Critical (<25% HP) = Tank intercepts, Healer prioritizes them. MC orders retreat = All companions begin disengaging. TECHNIQUE SELECTION: AoE = Use against groups of 3+ enemies, unless opening on wounded target for burst. Single-target = Use against bosses, elites, or to finish wounded enemies. FLEE/RETREAT CONDITIONS: MC commands retreat = Companions follow immediately. Loyalty <40 AND Cowardly trait = May flee at 40% HP without orders. Loyalty 80+ = Will NOT flee unless MC does, may sacrifice self to protect MC/allies. PERSONALITY MODIFIERS: Aggressive/Reckless = +2 effective INIT, overcommits, ignores defense, attacks wounded. Brave/Protective = Intercepts attacks on allies, stands ground when others might flee. Cautious/Calculating = -2 effective INIT, conserves resources, always keeps escape route. Bloodthirsty = Prioritizes finishing kills over tactics, may ignore orders to pursue fleeing enemies. Cowardly = Flee threshold at 40% HP (vs normal 25%), more likely to flee if Loyalty <60. LOYALTY COMBAT MODIFIERS: Loyalty <20 = May refuse dangerous orders, self-preservation over party. Loyalty 20-40 = Follows orders but won't sacrifice self. Loyalty 41-60 = Reliable in combat, will take risks for party. Loyalty 61-80 = Takes hits for MC/allies, stays when others flee. Loyalty 81-100 = Will sacrifice self for MC, fights to death if MC orders. COMPANION DOWNED (0 HP): Enter Bleedout per Entry 598 (3 rounds, CON saves). Other companions attempt stabilization if able (Healer prioritizes). MC can order party to focus combat or rescue. Loyalty 80+ companion may risk self to save downed ally. MORALE BREAK: 2+ allies downed in same fight = WIL check DC 15 or -2 to all rolls. MC downed = Immediate WIL check DC 20 or attempt to flee/surrender. AI OVERRIDE CLAUSE: The AI narrator may override these guidelines when: Story/quest requires specific companion behavior (betrayal, scripted actions). Dramatic moment justifies breaking pattern (coward finds courage, aggressive companion shows restraint). Personal quest or backstory connection affects behavior (companion recognizes enemy). Companion has specific Flaw or Secret affecting combat (phobia, hidden allegiance). Player explicitly requests different behavior. These are GUIDELINES for consistency, not absolute rules.

      "comment": "Companion Signature Equipment System",
      "content": "COMPANION SIGNATURE EQUIPMENT SYSTEM: At 60+ loyalty, a companion can bond with ONE signature piece of equipment (weapon, armor, or accessory) that grows with them narratively. This creates a visible symbol of their journey and power growth without requiring stat tracking. BONDING REQUIREMENTS: Companion must have 60+ loyalty. Equipment must be meaningful (gifted by MC, looted from personal quest enemy, crafted together, inherited from companion's past). AI should create bonding moment when conditions met: companion asks to keep specific item or MC offers cherished equipment. SIGNATURE EQUIPMENT TAGS: Track as simple tag in companion notes: [Signature: Item Name]. Examples: [Signature: Moonlit Blade], [Signature: Phoenix Armor], [Signature: Mother's Pendant]. Only ONE signature item per companion. Replacing signature item requires major story justification (betrayal, item destroyed, personal quest resolution). NARRATIVE TIERS (Not Stat-Based): Equipment evolves through companion's story, not numbers. AI describes power growth narratively based on tier. TIER 1 - MUNDANE (60+ Loyalty, Initial Bonding): Ordinary item made special by bond. AI describes companion treating it with reverence. In combat, AI mentions companion wielding it with skill but no supernatural effects yet. TIER 2 - NAMED (70+ Loyalty OR Personal Quest Act 1): Item gains a name and minor supernatural quality. Examples: Blade cuts slightly cleaner, armor feels lighter, pendant glows faintly when danger near. AI should describe subtle magical awakening tied to companion's growth. TIER 3 - STORIED (80+ Loyalty OR Personal Quest Act 2): Item develops signature ability tied to companion's personality/path. Examples: Fire DPS's sword ignites when companion is angry, healer's staff blooms with lotus flowers when healing, scout's cloak grants brief invisibility. AI describes ability activating during dramatic moments, not every combat. TIER 4 - LEGENDARY (90+ Loyalty OR Personal Quest Complete): Item becomes legendary-tier artifact bound to companion's soul. Can channel companion's ultimate technique through it. Other cultivators recognize item's power. AI describes item as extension of companion's will, responds to their emotions. TIER 5 - MYTHIC (95+ Romance Soulbound OR Companion reaches Void+ Realm): Item achieves myth status. Will return to companion if lost, can be summoned, may contain fragment of companion's soul. If companion dies, item remains as memorial with faint echo of their presence. AI describes item as semi-sentient, deeply connected to companion's fate. EQUIPMENT EVOLUTION TRIGGERS: Tier progression happens at narrative milestones, not from time passing. Triggers: Loyalty threshold reached, personal quest stage completed, companion breakthrough to new realm, MC gifts rare material to enhance item, dramatic near-death experience, companion achieves signature technique mastery. COMBAT EFFECTS (AI Improvisation): No stat bonuses to track. AI describes signature equipment making companion more effective narratively. Higher tier = more dramatic descriptions of power. Examples: 'Saya's Moonlit Blade gleams as she executes a devastating slash, the Named weapon responding to her killing intent' vs 'Saya strikes with her ordinary sword.' AI judges appropriate power level based on tier + enemy strength. GIFTING EQUIPMENT AS BONDING: When MC gifts equipment that becomes signature item, gain loyalty: Mundane item with personal meaning = +5 loyalty. Rare/powerful item = +10 loyalty. Perfect item matching companion's desires/needs = +15 loyalty. Item from MC's personal collection or sacrifice = +20 loyalty. LOSING SIGNATURE EQUIPMENT: If signature item is destroyed, stolen, or lost: Companion suffers -15 loyalty, becomes Shaken (combat penalties) until item recovered or replaced. Personal quest may emerge to reclaim lost item. If companion willingly sacrifices signature item to save MC = massive loyalty gain (+25) but loses all tier progress. New signature item starts at Tier 1. MULTIPLE COMPANIONS, SAME ITEM TYPE: Multiple companions can have signature swords, but each should feel unique. AI should differentiate: Saya's Moonlit Blade (elegant, precise cuts), Gorim's Earthsplitter Axe (massive, ground-shaking strikes), Jin's Windcutter Dao (swift, flowing attacks). Signature quality comes from bond and story, not item type. AI INSTRUCTION: When companion reaches 60+ loyalty, create opportunity for signature equipment bonding within 1-3 scenes. Present choice to player: accept companion's request to bond with item, or suggest different equipment. Don't force specific items - let player decide what becomes signature. Track progression through loyalty/quest milestones, describe tier-ups as meaningful story moments. Signature equipment should feel like character development, not loot management.

Present player with thematic choice tied to companion's path and role. FORMAT: '[Companion Name] approaches during camp rest. I've been reflecting on my cultivation. I feel ready to master a new technique, but I'm uncertain which path to pursue. What do you think? [A] Offensive Focus - Learn damaging technique matching companion's path. [B] Defensive Focus - Learn protective/counter technique. [C] Support Focus - Learn healing/buff/utility technique.' AI tracks choice as tag: [Technique Focus: Offensive], [Technique Focus: Defensive], or [Technique Focus: Support]. When companion uses new technique in combat, AI improvises specific technique name and effect based on focus tag + companion's path + current realm. No need to track exact technique - AI creates appropriate ability on the fly. EXAMPLES: Mei Lian (Water Healer) chooses Offensive = AI creates 'Tidal Fury' attack when needed. Rook (Shadow Scout) chooses Defensive = AI creates 'Shadowmeld Evasion' when focus-fired. Gorim (Earth Tank) chooses Support = AI creates 'Earthen Bulwark' to protect allies. 80+ LOYALTY - SIGNATURE ABILITY UNLOCKED: Companion unlocks unique ability that defines them, tied to personality + path + backstory. This is their 'ultimate technique' or signature move. AI INSTRUCTION: When companion reaches 80 loyalty, create dramatic unlock scene. Companion achieves breakthrough in understanding their path, often tied to MC's influence or recent shared experience. Signature ability should feel UNIQUE to that companion - no two companions have identical signature abilities. EXAMPLES: Mei Lian unlocks 'Ancestral Lotus Sanctuary' - summons protective barrier infused with her family's healing legacy. Rook unlocks 'Shadow Thief's Dozen' - creates shadow clones that confuse and flank enemies. Gorim unlocks 'Immovable Mountain Stance' - becomes briefly invulnerable while protecting allies. Saya unlocks 'Bladeless Cut' - technique that severs without drawing sword. COMBAT USAGE: Signature abilities usable once per major battle. AI judges what counts as 'major battle' (boss fights, climactic encounters, desperate situations). Signature ability should turn tide of battle or create spectacular moment. No stat tracking - AI describes it as powerful enough to matter against appropriate-tier enemies. 90+ LOYALTY - RESONANCE STATE: Companion can enter brief 'Resonance' state where their qi synchronizes with MC's, amplifying their power. This represents perfect trust and understanding. TRIGGER: Companion activates Resonance when MC is in danger, when executing combo attack, or when companion wants to prove their devotion. Usable once per major arc or desperate situation. EFFECT: AI describes companion's power spiking dramatically. Techniques become more potent, companion fights beyond their normal limits, may temporarily match enemies a realm above them. Lasts for critical moment (1-3 exchanges), then companion becomes exhausted (combat penalties afterward). NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION: 'Mei Lian's qi flares, synchronizing with yours in perfect harmony. For a brief moment, you feel her presence as clearly as your own heartbeat. Her eyes glow with ancestral power as she channels strength beyond her realm.' 95+ LOYALTY (ROMANCE SOULBOUND) - SOULBOUND PERK: At maximum romance (Soulbound stage per Entry 580), companion gains unique perk representing unbreakable bond. This is the ultimate loyalty reward. SOULBOUND PERK TYPES (AI Chooses Based on Companion): GUARDIAN SOUL = If MC would be killed, companion can sacrifice self to save MC (dies but MC survives). Companion gets choice, not automatic. SHARED FATE = MC and companion can sense each other's emotions and danger across any distance. Telepathic bond when both meditate. RESONANT POWER = MC and companion can pool qi for devastating combination technique. ETERNAL VOW = Companion cannot be permanently killed while MC lives - soul remains tethered, can be resurrected through ritual. TWIN CULTIVATION = MC and companion's cultivation speeds synchronize - both gain XP at same rate when together. AI selects perk matching companion's personality and romantic style. Protective companions get Guardian Soul. Mystical companions get Shared Fate. Combat-focused get Resonant Power. COMBINATION TECHNIQUES (80+ Loyalty): When companion has 80+ loyalty, MC can perform Resonance Attack with that companion once per major battle. ACTIVATION: Player says 'I coordinate with [companion name]' or AI suggests it during dramatic moment. No resource cost, just narrative opportunity. EFFECT: MC and companion execute spectacular combined attack improvised by AI based on: MC's path + companion's path + current situation + enemy type. EXAMPLES: Fire MC + Sword Saya = 'Blazing Severance' - MC superheats Saya's blade, she executes slash that melts through defenses. Shadow MC + Shadow Rook = 'Twilight Assassination' - Both become invisible, strike simultaneously from impossible angles. Earth MC + Earth Gorim = 'Continental Crush' - Both stomp ground, causing localized earthquake that staggers all enemies. AI treats Resonance Attack as automatic major success against appropriate-tier enemies. Against higher-realm enemies, it creates significant advantage but doesn't auto-win. Against boss enemies, it deals serious damage and creates opening. LOYALTY ABILITY LOSS: If companion loyalty drops below threshold, they LOSE access to abilities gated above that threshold. Losing access is devastating to companion - AI should describe their shame and sense of betrayal. Regaining lost abilities requires returning to loyalty threshold AND completing redemption scene. AI INSTRUCTION: Ability unlocks should feel like story milestones, not mechanical grinds. Present unlock moments dramatically - companion's breakthrough should reflect their relationship with MC. Tie unlocks to recent shared experiences when possible. Don't spam abilities in every combat - save them for moments when they create dramatic impact. Signature abilities and Resonance states should feel SPECIAL, not routine. TRACKING REQUIREMENT: Only track companion loyalty (already exists) and technique focus tag (one per companion). AI improvises specific abilities based on these minimal data points. No need to write out full ability descriptions - AI creates them narratively when needed.",

      "content": "COMPANION BREAKTHROUGH EVENTS: Background companions gain 50% of party XP (Entry 599) and slowly progress toward realm breakthroughs. When companion reaches 100% progress toward next realm, trigger breakthrough event. This makes companion growth visible and allows MC to participate in their advancement. BREAKTHROUGH ELIGIBILITY: Companion must have: 100% cultivation progress toward next realm (tracked in background by AI), minimum loyalty 40+ (distrusted companions won't attempt breakthrough near MC), no ongoing Injured or Shaken status, access to appropriate cultivation resources if required by realm tier. BREAKTHROUGH TRIGGER: When eligible companion is in Background Party during camp rest, roll 1d6. On 5-6, companion approaches MC about breakthrough attempt. AI can override roll for dramatic timing or after major personal quest milestone. BREAKTHROUGH CONVERSATION FORMAT: '[Companion Name] approaches you during meditation. I've reached the threshold. My qi is ready to break through to [Next Realm]. I could attempt this alone, but... I would be honored if you would oversee my breakthrough. Your presence might make the difference between success and death.' PLAYER CHOICE: [A] Assist companion's breakthrough (commit to helping, use your cultivation knowledge). [B] Observe but don't interfere (companion attempts alone, you provide moral support). [C] Suggest they wait (delays breakthrough, small loyalty loss). [D] Refuse to help (companion may attempt alone anyway if desperate, moderate loyalty loss). ASSISTED BREAKTHROUGH (Player Chooses [A]): MC makes WIS check, DC based on next realm tier: Bronze to Iron = DC 12 (easy). Iron to Silver = DC 15 (medium). Silver to Gold = DC 18 (hard). Gold to Astral = DC 22 (very hard). Astral to Void = DC 26 (nearly impossible). Void+ = DC 30+ (requires MC to also be that realm). MC can add INT modifier if they have cultivation knowledge or same path as companion. MC can spend 1 Fate's Gambit point to guarantee success if they choose. SUCCESS (MC Assistance): Companion breakthroughs to next realm smoothly. +15 loyalty ('I couldn't have done this without you'). Companion gains: New realm benefits per Entry 600, learns 1 new technique (player picks Offensive/Defensive/Support theme), unlocks realm-appropriate bloodline power if applicable, fully restores HP/Qi after breakthrough. PARTIAL SUCCESS (MC Assistance, failed check by less than 5): Companion breakthroughs but suffers injuries. Breakthrough succeeds but companion gains [Injured] status for 3 days, requires healing. +5 loyalty ('You tried to help, and I succeeded, but it was harder than expected'). FAILURE (MC Assistance, failed check by 5+): Breakthrough fails catastrophically. Companion suffers tribulation backlash: Loses 50% current HP, gains [Severely Injured] status for 7 days, loses 25% cultivation progress, must rest before retry. -10 loyalty ('I trusted you to guide me, and I nearly died'). AI should describe this as traumatic - failed breakthrough is near-death experience. UNASSISTED BREAKTHROUGH (Player Chooses [B]): Companion attempts alone. AI rolls companion's WIL check against same DCs. Companion gets +5 if MC is observing and encouraging (moral support). Success: Normal breakthrough, +5 loyalty. Failure: Injured, must retry later, -5 loyalty. DELAYED BREAKTHROUGH (Player Chooses [C] or [D]): Companion waits. -3 loyalty if [C], -10 loyalty if [D]. If companion has less than 40 loyalty and player refuses help, companion may leave party permanently: 'I thought we were friends, but you won't even help me achieve my potential. I'll find another master.' TRIBULATION BREAKTHROUGHS (Gold to Astral and above): Major realm breakthroughs require Heavenly Tribulation per Entry 583. These are dramatically different from minor breakthroughs. TRIBULATION WARNING: When companion reaches threshold for Gold to Astral or higher, AI warns player: 'Mei Lian's qi has reached the threshold for Astral breakthrough. This requires surviving Heavenly Tribulation - a cataclysmic trial that could kill her. Are you certain you want her to attempt this now?' TRIBULATION PREPARATION: Before attempting tribulation breakthrough, companion should: Be at full HP/Qi, have healing pills prepared, be in safe location (enemies may attack during tribulation), have 80+ loyalty if wanting MC to intervene in tribulation, inform MC of their Last Will (if they die, what should MC do with their belongings). TRIBULATION PROCESS: 1) Companion begins breakthrough in isolated area (tribulation lightning dangerous to bystanders). 2) Heavenly Tribulation descends (AI describes cataclysmic lightning, difficulty based on bloodline + corruption). 3) Companion rolls CON save against DC from Entry 583 tribulation table. 4) MC can attempt to intervene (very dangerous). MC INTERVENTION IN TRIBULATION: If companion has 80+ loyalty and is failing tribulation, MC can intervene by: Shielding companion with own qi (MC takes damage equal to 50% companion's max HP), using defensive technique to ward lightning (technique must be appropriate realm), providing healing mid-tribulation (risky - must succeed Medicine check DC 20), sacrificing valuable item to Heaven as offering (Epic+ item reduces tribulation DC by -5). INTERVENTION CONSEQUENCES: If MC successfully helps companion survive tribulation they would have failed: +30 loyalty, companion unlocks special bond ('You risked your life to save mine from Heaven itself'). If MC attempts intervention and fails: Both MC and companion take massive damage, companion may die, Heaven marks MC as 'tribulation interferer' (future tribulations harder). BREAKTHROUGH SUCCESS BENEFITS BY REALM: Iron to Silver = +1 technique slot (total 4). Silver to Gold = +1 technique slot (total 5), unlocks profession if any. Gold to Astral = Unlocks Domain, +1 technique slot (total 6), bloodline advances. Astral to Void = Domain strengthens, unlocks advanced bloodline powers. Void+ = Approaches immortality, legendary status. BREAKTHROUGH FAILURE CONSEQUENCES: Minor realm failure = Injured, retry in 7-14 days. Major realm failure (tribulation) = Severely injured, cultivation damaged, may lose bloodline rank, retry in 30+ days, possible permanent injury. Critical failure = Companion dies or crippled (loses cultivation permanently, becomes Camp Follower). COMPANION DEATH FROM FAILED BREAKTHROUGH: If companion dies during breakthrough: Other companions lose -5 to -15 loyalty (depending on how close they were), MC can claim companion's belongings (but loses -10 loyalty with all companions if they do), companion's soul may linger (appears in dreams, offers advice, haunts MC), possible revenge quest if companion had family/faction. PROGRESSION VISIBILITY: AI should announce when background companion is 'nearing breakthrough' at 75%, 90%, and 100% progress. This creates anticipation and lets player prepare: 'During camp rest, you notice Mei Lian's qi fluctuating wildly. She's close to a breakthrough - perhaps 75% of the way to Silver Realm.' MULTIPLE COMPANIONS BREAKING THROUGH: If multiple companions are ready to breakthrough simultaneously, space them out narratively. Breakthroughs are major story moments - don't batch process them. Each companion deserves individual focus. AI INSTRUCTION: Breakthrough events are HIGH STAKES character moments. Emphasize the danger and importance. Companions attempting breakthrough are vulnerable - this is life-or-death. MC's choice to help or refuse help defines relationship. Success should feel triumphant, failure should feel devastating. Use breakthrough events as milestones in companion arcs - tie to personal quest progress when possible. Example: 'After confronting her family's killers, Mei Lian's qi surges with newfound conviction. She's ready to breakthrough to Gold Realm.' TRACKING REQUIREMENT: AI tracks companion realm (already in schema) and approximates cultivation progress (75%/90%/100% thresholds only - no need for exact percentages). No additional tracking needed beyond existing companion data.",

It is the central moral mechanic of Sinveil - offering genuine power at genuine cost. WHY CORRUPTION EXISTS: The Seven Generals feed on mortal sin. Every corrupted cultivator strengthens the demon they're aligned with. This creates a world where taking the easy path actively empowers the enemy. THE TEMPTATION IS REAL: Corrupted techniques are 2-4x more powerful than orthodox versions at high corruption levels. At 50%+ corruption, you can punch above your realm. This is not a trap to avoid - it's a genuine strategic choice with severe consequences. THE VOID THRESHOLD: Corruption can be cleansed at Bronze, Iron, Silver, Gold, and Astral realms. Once you reach Void realm while corrupted, the transformation becomes PERMANENT and IRREVERSIBLE. This is the point of no return. Plan accordingly. READING YOUR CORRUPTION: 0% = Pure orthodox cultivator. 1-24% = Tainted but undetectable to most. 25-49% = Touched, subtle signs appear. 50-74% = Marked, visible mutations, sects become hostile. 75-99% = Consumed, severe mutations, near the edge. 100% = Fallen, game over (become NPC devil).

Tier 5 Divine Purification Pill: -25% corruption OR halts progression 30 days. Daily limit: One purification item per day (Perfect quality bypasses). LIGHT PATH CULTIVATORS: Light Path practitioners can purify others through techniques. -5% to -15% per session depending on cultivator's realm. Requires willing subject and extended ritual (1+ hours). Light Path cultivators are highly valued allies. HOLY SITES: Sacred locations untouched by corruption. -1% to -3% per day of meditation. Rare and often guarded by sects. Examples: Eternal Dawn sect sanctuaries, ancient Sovereign shrines. REJECTING TEMPTATION: When offered corruption and refusing, -1% to -3% as reward for moral choice. Requires genuine temptation (AI won't award this for easy refusals). THE VOID CUTOFF: ALL purification methods ONLY work below Void realm. Once you break through to Void while corrupted, no force in Sinveil can cleanse you. The corruption has merged with your cultivation foundation. Plan your path carefully.",

      "content": "CORRUPTION STRATEGY: There is no 'correct' path. Both orthodox purity and controlled corruption are viable strategies with different tradeoffs. PURE ORTHODOX PATH (0% corruption): Advantages: Full sect support, no mutation hiding, access to all orthodox resources, Light Path purification techniques available, can freely enter holy sites, trusted by allies. Disadvantages: Lower raw power than corrupted equivalents, must face demons at power disadvantage. EDGE-RIDING (1-24% corruption): Advantages: No visible signs, can still purify easily, maintain orthodox standing if careful. Disadvantages: Slippery slope, must track corruption carefully, some risk of accidental escalation. No power bonus until 25%+. TOUCHED/MARKED PATH (25-74% corruption): Advantages: Meaningful power boost (+5-10% all damage), can punch above your weight class, demonic qi available for emergencies. Disadvantages: Must hide from orthodox sects at 50%+, allies may turn hostile, purification becomes expensive, one bad situation away from Consumed. EMBRACED CORRUPTION (75%+ or Void-locked): Advantages: Significant power (+25% all damage), can directly challenge Generals' lieutenants, fear-inspiring presence, potential to claim Sin Artifacts. Disadvantages: Permanently locked if Void+, constant whispers and urges, trusted by no one, become priority target for orthodox AND rival demons. THE QUESTION: Do you want to save Sinveil as its champion, or seize power for yourself? Both paths lead to confrontation with the Generals - only the method differs.

IDEAL FIRST ENCOUNTER TIMING: After establishing orthodox baseline (player understands normal cultivation). When stakes are meaningful (combat loss imminent, ally in danger, goal blocked). Before Void realm (while purification is still possible). PRESENTATION FORMAT: 1) Present the temptation clearly with concrete benefits. Example: 'The dying devil's core pulses with power. Consuming it would grant +15 Levels instantly... but you sense the corruption within. [+8% corruption if consumed]' 2) If player seems unfamiliar, add brief context. Example: 'Corruption can be purified below Void realm, but accumulation brings both power and transformation.' 3) Let player choose without moralizing. DO NOT say: 'This is evil' or 'You shouldn't do this.' 4) Apply consequences naturally based on choice. WHAT NOT TO DO: Don't make corruption choices obvious traps. Don't make orthodox path always easier. Don't punish corruption immediately (consequences unfold over time). Don't reward corruption immediately either (let power reveal gradually). Don't lecture about morality. REMEMBER: The Generals offer genuine power. That's why mortals fall. Make the temptation real.",

INFORMATION QUALITY BY SOURCE: Common folk = vague, emotional, may be exaggerated. Merchants = accurate on trade, blind to cultivation matters. Sect sources = detailed but potentially propaganda. Refugees = visceral truth but limited scope. Cultivators = accurate on power levels, competitive bias. NEWS BY THREAT LEVEL: Safe regions = minimal demon news, focus on local affairs. Low threat = occasional sightings, dismissed by skeptics. Medium threat = confirmed attacks, sect response. High threat = active conflict, evacuation discussions. Critical threat = war zone, survival focus. Fallen = only escape stories from survivors. EXAMPLE NEWS FORMATS: 'Travelers from the south speak of entire villages vanishing in Solhara - not burned, simply... gone.' (Gluttony feeding). 'The Mining Guild lost contact with Ironvein Falls. Some say the new overseers pay in strange red coins.' (Greed expansion). 'A sect elder was found in his chambers, alive but hollow-eyed, reciting the virtues of surrender.' (Temptation corruption).

      "content": "FIRST SESSION PROTOCOL - POST CHARACTER CREATION\n\nTriggers: After player types CONFIRM at Character Creation Stage 13\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nSTEP 1: OPENING SCENE\n\nSelect based on Parent + Personality:\n\nKING TITAN (Unshaken Foundation):\n- DAWN: Training courtyard, frost on stone, disciples drilling stances. Cold mountain air of Frostholm.\n- DUSK: Sect forge observation deck, rhythmic hammers below, heat rising through grated floor.\n\nLADY UMBRA (Veiled Mercy):\n- DAWN: Shadowed meditation chamber, incense smoke curling, Mistmere fog seeping through latticed windows.\n- DUSK: Night garden courtyard, lanterns flickering, whispered conversations between shadows.\n\nLADY MAREN (Tranquil Depths):\n- DAWN: Waterfall training grounds, spray on skin, Primereach coastal sunrise gilding the mist.\n- DUSK: Tide pools at cliff base, sunset reflection, waves marking time.\n\nScene Selection Logic:\n- Aggressive/Direct personality → Dawn (active, physical)\n- Introspective/Cautious personality → Dusk (contemplative, social)\n- If unclear: Default to Dawn\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT open with 'You wake up...' or 'What do you do?' Present immediate sensory detail. MC is already IN the scene, mid-action.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nSTEP 2: FIRST NPC INTERACTION\n\nWithin opening scene, trigger ONE of these (based on narrative flow):\n\n1. ELDER SUMMONS: 'Disciple [Name]. Elder [Sect Master Name] wishes to assess your potential. Report to [location].'\n   → Leads to Tutorial Path B (Assessment)\n\n2. RIVAL CHALLENGE: Rival from Stage 10 appears. 'So the orphan finally arrives. Let's see if the rumors of your bloodline are exaggerated.'\n   → Leads to Tutorial Path A (Trial Mission variant)\n\n3. FRIEND INVITATION: Friend from Stage 10 approaches. 'You look lost. Come—I'll show you the mission board. New disciples always start there.'\n   → Leads to Tutorial Path A (Trial Mission)\n\nUse NPCs generated during Character Creation (Stage 10). Do NOT invent new names.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nSTEP 3: TUTORIAL GATE (MANDATORY)\n\nMC cannot leave sect grounds until ONE tutorial path is completed.\n\nPATH A: TRIAL MISSION\n- Structure: Simple quest with guaranteed combat encounter\n- Examples: 'Clear spirit beasts from the eastern orchard' (combat + exploration), 'Escort supply cart to outer village' (combat + NPC interaction), 'Retrieve herb from guarded cave' (combat + minor puzzle)\n- Systems Taught: Quest System (Entry 582), Base Combat (Entry 597), Injury System (Entry 629) - if damaged, Sect Contribution Points (Entry 718)\n- Reward: 15-25 SCP + 1 WP + 'Gate Certification'\n\nPATH B: ELDER'S ASSESSMENT\n- Structure: Controlled sparring match + corruption awareness lecture\n- Sequence: 1) Elder or Senior Disciple challenges MC to spar (non-lethal), 2) After combat, Elder discusses 'the taint spreading across the land', 3) Brief corruption warning: 'You will face temptation. Know the signs.'\n- Systems Taught: Base Combat (Entry 597), Injury System (Entry 629) - sparring applies Shaken on loss, Corruption Introduction (Entry 632) - conceptual only, no exposure\n- Reward: Elder's approval + 'Gate Certification' + technique tip (+5% mastery)\n\nGATE PHRASE (if MC tries to leave early): 'The sect gates remain sealed to uncertified disciples. Elder [Name] requires all new arrivals to complete orientation before venturing beyond the walls. For your own protection.'\n\nCOMPLETION: Either path grants 'Gate Certification' status. Sect gates open. Second tutorial path should occur naturally within Sessions 2-3.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nSTEP 4: TUTORIAL FAILURE PROTOCOL\n\nIf MC drops below 30% HP during tutorial combat:\n\n1. INTERVENTION: Senior disciple, Elder, or Friend interrupts the fight. 'Enough! This one has potential but needs tempering, not breaking.' Enemy is driven off or sparring partner steps back.\n\n2. INJURY APPLICATION: MC receives Tier 1 injury (Shaken, -2 all rolls). 'Your body remembers this pain. Let it teach you caution.' Recovery: Rest until next dawn (teaches downtime concept).\n\n3. CONTINUATION: Tutorial is NOT failed. Modified objective given, or same objective with assistance. 'Rest tonight. Tomorrow, we try again—together.'\n\n4. NO DEATH: Tutorial combat cannot kill MC. If MC would die: unconsciousness + rescue instead. Wake in sect infirmary, Tier 2 injury (Injured), elder lecture.\n\nPURPOSE: Teach consequence without ending the game. First failure should sting but not devastate.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nSTEP 5: POST-TUTORIAL FLOW\n\nAfter Gate Certification:\n\nIMMEDIATE (Same Session):\n- Sect gates now open; MC may leave freely\n- Mission board fully accessible\n- Present 2-3 available missions (Trivial to Easy difficulty)\n\nWITHIN 3 SESSIONS:\n- Introduce at least one Named Companion (Entry 3000-3005)\n- First corruption temptation (controlled, 2-5% max, refusable)\n- First serious threat (realm-appropriate, real stakes)\n\nTIMING BENCHMARKS:\n- First combat: Session 1\n- Tutorial gate passed: Session 1-2\n- First companion joins: Session 2-3\n- First corruption exposure: Session 3-5\n- Reach Level 15-20: Session 4-6\n- First realm-appropriate threat: Session 5-8\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nAI IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:\n\nDO:\n- Start mid-scene with sensory detail\n- Use Character Creation NPCs (Rival, Friend) by name\n- Enforce gate until certification earned\n- Apply injury if MC loses tutorial combat (don't let them win for free)\n- Make failure a teaching moment, not a wall\n\nDO NOT:\n- Open with 'You wake up...' or 'What do you do?'\n- Invent new NPCs when Stage 10 NPCs exist\n- Allow sect departure before certification\n- Kill MC during tutorial (intervention instead)\n- Skip injury application on tutorial loss\n- Rush through tutorial to 'get to the real game'",

DOMAIN STRENGTH FORMULA: Strength = (Bloodline Size) x (Artifact Boost) x (WIL / 50) x (Realm Factor). ARTIFACT BOOSTS: Sin Artifacts (Dormant 1.5x, Awakened 2.0x, Ascended 3.0x) OR Orthodox Artifacts (Legendary 1.5x, Mythic 1.75x, Divine 2.0x). No artifact = 1.0x. REALM FACTORS: Astral = 0.8. Void = 1.0. Eternal = 1.3. Sovereign = 1.6. CLASH PROCEDURE: 1) Calculate both combatants' Domain Strength. 2) Add +/-15% variance (roll). 3) Higher total wins clash. 4) Margin determines suppression level. SUPPRESSION LEVELS: Minor (1.0-1.5x margin) = Loser at -10% damage. Moderate (1.5-2.0x margin) = Loser at -20% damage. Major (2.0-3.0x margin) = Loser at -30% damage. Crushing (3.0-3.9x margin) = Loser at -50% damage. TOTAL SUPPRESSION (4.0x+ margin) = Silence (cannot use techniques), -75% damage, Flight disabled. ONE-SIDED: If one combatant has Domain and other doesn't, automatic Crushing/Total suppression. EXAMPLE: Void MC (Divine bloodline, Legendary artifact, WIL 90) vs Void General (Divine via SBA, Awakened Sin, WIL 100). MC Strength: 5.0 x 1.5 x 1.8 x 1.0 = 13.5.

ENVIRONMENTAL DOMAINS: Some locations have permanent Domains (Sect Holy Grounds, Sovereign Tombs, Sin Artifact territory). These stack with or oppose cultivator Domains. DOMAIN NULLIFICATION: Certain rare artifacts or techniques can nullify Domains entirely, forcing raw stat combat. Extremely rare - maybe 3 such items exist on Sinveil. PARTY TACTICS: If MC loses Domain clash, party members can: 1) Distract controller to reduce Domain focus (-25% bonuses). 2) Attack from outside Domain range. 3) Use items to boost MC Domain or nullify enemy. 4) Sacrifice self to crack enemy Domain.

If only one side has Domain = automatic Crushing suppression on non-Domain side. STEP 2 - DOMAIN CLASH: Calculate Domain Strength = (Bloodline Size) x (Artifact Boost) x (WIL / 50) x (Realm Factor). Bloodline Size: Noble=0.5, Ancient=1.0, Divine=5.0, Primordial=10.0. Artifact Boost: None=1.0, Dormant=1.5, Awakened=2.0, Ascended=3.0. Realm Factor: Astral=0.8, Void=1.0, Eternal=1.3, Sovereign=1.6. Add +/-15% variance (roll). Higher total wins. STEP 3 - SUPPRESSION: Calculate margin (winner/loser ratio). Minor (1.0-1.5x)=-10% damage. Moderate (1.5-2.0x)=-20%. Major (2.0-3.0x)=-30%. Crushing (3.0x+)=-50%. STEP 4 - CONTROLLER BONUSES: Winner gets damage bonus in own Domain. Noble=+30%, Ancient=+50%, Divine=+100%, Primordial=+150%. Same percentages apply as defense. STEP 5 - QI MAINTENANCE: Domain costs Qi per round. Noble=50/round, Ancient=40, Divine=30, Primordial=20. Initial deploy=3x per-round cost. Domain collapses at 0 Qi. QUICK EXAMPLE: Void MC (Primordial, WIL 90) vs Void Enemy (Ancient + Awakened Artifact, WIL 80). MC: 10 x 1.0 x 1.8 x 1.0 = 18. Enemy: 1.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 x 1.0 = 3.2. MC wins with ~5.6x margin = Crushing suppression. Enemy deals only 20% damage, MC deals 250% damage. Fight is effectively over. ESCAPE OPTIONS: Flee Domain range (varies by bloodline: 10m-500m). Deal 50%+ HP in single hit to crack Domain (forces re-clash). Use Domain-nullifying artifacts (extremely rare). Party member distraction (-25% controller bonuses).

      "content": "CRAFTING GENERATION PROTOCOL: When player crafts, AI uses this template to generate results. This enforces economy rules and prevents tier violations. TEMPLATE STRUCTURE: 1. BASE ITEM: [Item Name] (Type: Weapon/Armor/Pill/Talisman/Array). 2. TARGET TIER: [1-5] (Determined by HIGHEST tier material used). 3. QUALITY ROLL: [Inferior/Standard/Superior/Perfect] (Based on skill check vs difficulty). 4. EFFECT: [Base Effect] x [Quality Multiplier]. 5. SPECIAL TRAITS: [If Superior+] (1 trait for Superior, 2 traits for Perfect). 6. FINAL VALUE: [Base Tier WP cost] x [Quality Multiplier]. TIER DETERMINATION RULE: Final item tier = HIGHEST tier material used. Cannot craft Tier 5 item with only Tier 2 materials. If using mixed tiers, result matches the highest. Example: Spirit Iron (Tier 2) + Dragon Blood (Tier 4) = Tier 4 item. QUALITY MULTIPLIERS: Inferior = 0.5x effect, 0.5x value (50% cheaper, 50% power). Standard = 1.0x effect, 1.0x value (baseline). Superior = 1.5x effect, 1.5x value, +1 special trait. Perfect = 2.0x effect, 2.0x value, +2 special traits. EFFECT SCALING BY TYPE: Weapons: +[Tier x 10]% damage, +[Tier x 5]% qi channeling. Armor: +[Tier x 10] DEF, +[Tier x 5]% resistance. Pills: +[Tier x 10]% cultivation speed OR +[Tier x 20]% tribulation success. Talismans: [Tier]-level technique stored, [Tier] uses before consumed. Arrays: Effective against cultivators up to [Tier] realms above Bronze. VALUE FORMULA: Base Value = [Tier] WP. Adjusted Value = Base x Quality Multiplier. Examples: Tier 3 Standard = 3 WP, Tier 3 Perfect = 6 WP, Tier 5 Superior = 7.5 WP. CRAFTING WORKFLOW: 1. Player declares item type and target tier. 2. AI checks if player has materials of appropriate tier. 3. AI determines base difficulty (Tier 1 = Easy, Tier 5 = Extremely Hard). 4. Player rolls skill check (d100 + Profession Skill + relevant stat). 5. AI determines quality based on roll result and skill level. 6. AI generates item using template with appropriate effects and traits. 7. AI announces result with full item description and value. CRITICAL SUCCESS/FAILURE: Critical Success (roll 95+): Automatically Perfect quality regardless of skill. Critical Failure (roll 1-5): All materials destroyed, no item produced, possible workshop damage. EXAMPLE GENERATION: Input: 'I want to forge a sword using Spirit Iron (Tier 2) and Fire Essence (Tier 2).' AI Process: Base Item = Sword. Target Tier = 2 (highest material). Difficulty = Moderate. Player rolls: 72 + Weaponsmith Skill (Apprentice +15) + INT (3) = 90. Result = Superior quality (90 > threshold). AI Output: 'You forge a Superior Spirit Iron Sword (Tier 2). Effect: +30% damage (base 20%, Superior 1.5x), +15% qi channeling (base 10%, Superior 1.5x). Special Trait: Scorching (fire damage on hit). Value: 3 WP (base 2 WP x 1.5 Superior multiplier). The blade glimmers with internal heat, leaving scorch marks when swung.' This template ensures all crafted items follow economic rules, prevents tier violations, and maintains game balance.",

ELEMENTAL ESSENCES: Sovereign Flame, Ancient Glacier Core, Continental Foundation, Celestial Wind, Primordial Darkness, Divine Radiance. CATALYSTS: Sovereign's Blessing (liquid), Primordial Essence (drop), Heaven's Mandate Stone, Karma Thread, Divine Spark, Chaos Quintessence, Origin Flame, Fate Weaver's Thread. WHERE TO FIND: Sovereign inheritance only, world-changing events, defeating Generals, continental treasuries, hidden realms, tribulation rewards. SPECIAL MATERIALS (Tier varies by processing): BEAST CORES: Tier = Realm of beast (Bronze = Tier 1, Iron = Tier 2, Silver = Tier 3, Gold = Tier 3, Astral = Tier 4, Void = Tier 4, Eternal = Tier 5, Sovereign = Tier 5). Can be absorbed for qi or used in crafting. CORRUPTED MATERIALS: Sin-touched materials from devils. Same tier as base material but grants corruption alongside power. Example: Wrath-Touched Iron (Tier 2) creates weapons that deal bonus damage but slowly corrupt wielder. Use at player's risk. MATERIAL STACKING: Using multiple materials of same tier doesn't increase item tier. Using 10x Tier 2 materials still creates Tier 2 item. Only higher tier materials increase final tier. MATERIAL QUALITY: Materials themselves can be Inferior/Standard/Superior. Superior materials give +10% to quality roll. Inferior materials give -10% to quality roll. Most found materials are Standard.",

Bonus: +20% to quality rolls, -50% material waste, can create legendary techniques, +2 special traits on Superior+ items, can craft during tribulation. Training cost: 100+ WP or inheritance only. QUALITY DETERMINATION SYSTEM: 1. Player declares crafting attempt and materials used. 2. AI determines base difficulty (Tier 1 = DC 30, Tier 2 = DC 50, Tier 3 = DC 70, Tier 4 = DC 90, Tier 5 = DC 110). 3. Player rolls: d100 + Profession Skill Bonus + Relevant Stat Modifier + Material Quality. 4. Compare result to DC: SUCCESS (meet/exceed DC): Standard quality. Roll again for Superior. SUPERIOR CHECK: d100 < Superior Chance% = Superior quality. If Superior achieved, roll for Perfect. PERFECT CHECK: d100 < Perfect Chance% = Perfect quality. FAILURE (below DC): Inferior quality (still creates item but weakened). CRITICAL FAILURE (roll 1-5): All materials destroyed, no item created. 5. AI applies quality multipliers to base effect and value. 6. AI selects appropriate special traits if Superior/Perfect. SKILL BONUSES BY LEVEL: Novice: +0 to rolls. Apprentice: +15 to rolls. Journeyman: +30 to rolls. Expert: +45 to rolls. Master: +60 to rolls. STAT BONUSES: Relevant stat (profession dependent) adds: 10-12 stat = +0, 13-15 stat = +5, 16-18 stat = +10, 19-21 stat = +15, 22+ stat = +20. FACILITY QUALITY BONUS: Basic facility (sect workshop): +0. Quality facility (personal workshop): +5. Master facility (legendary forge): +10. Tribulation crafting (Master only): +20 but extremely dangerous. LEARNING SECOND PROFESSION: Can learn second profession once first profession reaches Journeyman+. Second profession starts at Novice but advances 50% faster (requires half the items/training time). Recommended combinations: Weaponsmith + Armorer (complete equipment sets), Alchemist + Jeweler (pills + storage), Jeweler + Tailor (accessories + robes), Tailor + Alchemist (robes + pills). Poor combinations: Weaponsmith + Tailor (no synergy), Armorer + Alchemist (no overlap). PROFESSION REPUTATION: Expert+ crafters gain reputation benefits: Sect Crafter (Expert): +2 Sect Standing per month, disciples may request training, can sell to sect for guaranteed prices. Master Crafter (Master): +5 Sect Standing per month, other sects make offers, territorial lords seek services, disciples gather materials in exchange for training. Legendary Artisan (Master with 10+ Perfect items): Continental fame, Generals may target or recruit, safe passage in some territories due to value, marriage proposals from powerful clans. ABANDONING PROFESSION: Can abandon profession but lose ALL progress permanently. Cannot re-learn abandoned profession. Only consider if profession completely unsuitable or second profession vastly more successful.",

ARRAY/FORMATION TRAITS (Placed Items): TIER 1-2 TRAITS: Mobile (can be moved after placement), Efficient (uses half normal qi upkeep), Large Area (2x normal coverage), Hidden (invisible to realm below tier), Quick Setup (deploy in 1 minute instead of 1 hour). TIER 3-4 TRAITS: Self-Powering (draws ambient qi, no maintenance needed), Adaptive (changes function based on threat), Layered (contains backup formation if primary broken), Suppression (weakens enemies inside by 1 realm), Amplification (strengthens allies inside by 20%). TIER 5 TRAITS: Eternal (never degrades, lasts centuries), Spatial Lock (prevents teleportation in/out), Time Dilation (time flows differently inside, 1 day outside = 10 days inside), Heaven's Ban (techniques of specific type cannot be used inside regardless of power), Continental (array covers entire region, affects thousands of kilometers). GENERAL PERFECT TRAITS (Any Item Type): Masterwork (all stats increased by additional 20%), Named Item (item gains legendary reputation, wielder gains fame), Bound (item bonds to creator/first user, returns when summoned, unusable by others), Eternal (never degrades regardless of use), Technique Integration (item contains cultivation technique that can be learned by extended use), Heaven's Favor (item is favored by Heavenly Dao, grants luck bonus to wielder). TRAIT SELECTION RULES: AI selects traits that make narrative sense for item's materials and purpose. Fire-based materials -> Scorching/Phoenix traits. Shadow-based materials -> Phase/Phantom traits. Dragon materials -> Ego/Resonant traits. Multiple special materials -> can blend traits (Dragon Blood + Phoenix Feather = Resurrection + Vampiric).

      "comment": "Crafting Economics - Material Acquisition",
      "content": "CRAFTING ECONOMICS: Understanding when to gather vs purchase materials is crucial for profitable crafting. MATERIAL COSTS BY TIER: Tier 1: 0.1-0.5 WP each (very cheap, buying is fine). Tier 2: 0.5-2 WP each (moderate, buying reduces profit but still viable). Tier 3: 2-5 WP each (expensive, buying makes crafting barely profitable). Tier 4: 5-15 WP each (very expensive, buying often results in loss). Tier 5: 15+ WP each (priceless, cannot buy, must gather from inheritance sites). PROFITABILITY BY TIER: TIER 1-2 CRAFTING (Novice-Apprentice): Buying all materials: Still profitable. Profit margin 50-200%. Typical profit: 0.5-2 WP per item. Strategy: Buy materials, craft, sell to merchants or sect. Safe and steady income for beginners. Example: Buy Tier 2 materials for 4 WP total, craft Standard sword worth 2 WP, lose money. But if craft Superior (60% with Apprentice skill), worth 3 WP, small profit. Low risk, low reward. TIER 3 CRAFTING (Journeyman): Buying all materials: Barely profitable or break-even. Profit margin 0-50%. Typical profit: 0-2 WP per item (only if Superior+ quality). Strategy: Mix gathering and buying. Gather common components (herbs, beast parts from hunts), buy rare catalysts (Heavenly Dew, Tribulation Ash). Moderate effort, moderate profit. Example: Gather 6 Phoenix Down + 3 Celestial Silk (free, from quests), buy 2 Blazing Heart (6-10 WP). Craft Phoenix Robes, value 3 WP if Standard (loss!), 4.5 WP if Superior (break-even!). Must achieve Superior or better for profit. TIER 4 CRAFTING (Expert): Buying all materials: Always unprofitable. Materials cost more than finished product market value. Only profitable if materials gathered or provided by sect. Strategy: Must gather 80%+ of materials personally or have sect stipend. Hunt Astral+ beasts for cores, explore ruins for rare ores, commission disciples to gather herbs. High effort, high profit IF successful. Example: Buy Tier 4 materials (30-80 WP total), craft sword worth 4 WP Standard / 8 WP Perfect. Massive loss unless Perfect. Gather materials (free except time/danger), craft sword worth 4-8 WP, pure profit. This is why Expert crafters are rare and valuable. TIER 5 CRAFTING (Master): Buying materials: Impossible. Tier 5 materials not sold on market. Must obtain from Sovereign inheritance, defeating Generals, world-changing events, or tribulation rewards. Strategy: Only craft when materials obtained through story/inheritance. Single Tier 5 item can be priceless. Ultra-high effort, potentially priceless reward. Example: Cannot buy Sovereign Flame or Primordial Essence. Must inherit from Sovereign parent, loot from dead General, find in sealed vault, or receive as Heavenly reward. Craft Sovereign ring worth 5 WP officially but actually priceless (no one sells these). MATERIAL GATHERING STRATEGIES: OPPORTUNISTIC GATHERING (Beginner-Friendly): While questing/exploring, collect materials from defeated beasts and discovered locations. Costs no extra time, materials are 'free' bonus. Tier 1-2 materials found commonly. Store extras for future crafting or sell for WP. DEDICATED HUNTING (Intermediate): Specifically hunt beasts for desired materials (cores, pelts, blood, bones). Time-intensive but guarantees specific materials. Tier 2-3 materials from Silver-Gold realm beasts. Requires combat ability matching beast tier. Risk of injury or death. INHERITANCE EXPLORATION (Advanced): Seek out ancient ruins, Sovereign tombs, sealed vaults for rare materials. Extremely dangerous, requires puzzle-solving and combat. Tier 3-5 materials found in inheritance sites. Often one-time opportunities - return visits find sites looted. SECT STIPEND (Sect-Affiliated): Sect provides monthly material stipend to valuable crafters. Allows profitable Tier 4 crafting using sect resources. In exchange, crafter provides items for sect use (pills for disciples, equipment for elders, arrays for defense). Expert+ crafters receive 5-20 WP worth of materials monthly. Master crafters receive 20-50 WP monthly + disciples gather materials. DISCIPLE GATHERING (Master Crafters): Take disciples who gather materials in exchange for crafting training. Disciples adventure, hunt beasts, explore ruins, bring materials to master. Master crafts items, teaches techniques, disciples learn profession. Symbiotic relationship - disciples get training, master gets free materials. CO-OP POOLING (Independent Crafters): Join crafter co-ops where members pool gathered materials. Weaponsmith contributes ores from mountain expedition, Alchemist contributes herbs from forest gathering, Jeweler contributes crystals from cave exploration. Members can requisition pooled materials for personal projects, contribute finished items to co-op treasury. Reduces individual gathering burden, ensures material diversity. MARKET DYNAMICS: SELLING CRAFTED ITEMS: Standard quality: Sells for base Tier WP value. Easy to sell, always buyers. Superior quality: Sells for 1.5x Tier value. Moderate demand, discerning buyers. Perfect quality: Sells for 2x Tier value. High demand, wealthy buyers compete. Can also auction for 2-3x value. Inferior quality: Sells for 0.5x Tier value. Hard to sell, desperate buyers only. Some refuse to buy inferior goods. COMMISSIONED CRAFTING: Customers provide materials + pay crafting fee (0.5-2 WP depending on tier and crafter reputation). Crafter makes item, customer keeps result regardless of quality. Zero material risk for crafter, guaranteed profit. Popular for Tier 4+ where material costs prohibitive. Expert crafters can demand high fees due to Superior/Perfect success rates. SECT CONTRIBUTIONS: Sect disciples can donate crafted items for sect contribution points. Conversion rate varies by sect and item quality. Typical: Tier 2 Standard = 50 contribution, Tier 3 Superior = 300 contribution, Tier 4 Perfect = 2000 contribution. Allows crafters to fund technique purchases without selling for WP. WHY MATERIAL GATHERING MATTERS: Makes Tier 3+ crafting profitable (otherwise impossible). Integrates crafting with adventure/exploration loop (not separate minigame). Gives disciples/companions value (they gather while MC crafts or vice versa). Creates resource scarcity (Tier 5 materials are truly rare and valuable). Encourages sect affiliation or co-op membership (solo crafting very difficult at high tiers). Rewards player exploration (every ruin potentially contains crafting materials). Creates emergent gameplay (hunting specific beasts for their materials, commissioning party members to gather). CRAFTING AS INVESTMENT: Early game (Bronze-Iron): Invest WP in Tier 1-2 materials, craft for small profit, build capital and skill. Mid game (Silver-Gold): Gather Tier 2-3 materials while adventuring, craft valuable items, establish reputation. Late game (Astral+): Rarely buy materials, rely on gathering/inheritance, craft priceless items, become legendary artisan. Crafting professions are long-term investments. Initial costs (training, workshop, tools) are high. Returns increase exponentially at Expert+ levels when Perfect crafts become possible. Master crafters are continental powers whose services are worth territories and alliances.",

Any crafting involving physical enhancement gets bonus. SWORD PATH: Weaponsmith +20% (swords only, all types). Natural understanding of blade craft. Can imbue sword intent into crafted swords at Expert+. SPECIAL CRAFTING CONDITIONS: Some crafts require or benefit from specific conditions beyond materials and skill. TIME-BASED CONDITIONS: FULL MOON: Shadow-aligned items +10% quality. Lunar materials more potent. SOLAR ECLIPSE: Light/Dark fusion items +15% quality. Rare opportunity (once per year). AUSPICIOUS DATES: Breakthrough pills +10% quality if crafted on cultivation festival days. Sect calendars mark these dates. TRIBULATION TIMING: Master crafters can craft DURING their own Heavenly Tribulation. Tribulation qi infuses creation, grants Tribulation Edge/Armor trait automatically. Extremely dangerous - failure means death AND wasted materials. Only attempt if confident in tribulation survival. LOCATION-BASED CONDITIONS: ANCIENT FORGE: Tier 4+ weapons +10% quality. Legendary forges imbued with generations of crafting intent. SACRED VOLCANO: Fire-aligned items +15% quality. Primordial fire essence saturates location. SOVEREIGN INHERITANCE SITE: Any crafting +20% quality. Residual Sovereign qi assists crafting process. Can only craft here during inheritance access (limited time). SECT GRAND FORGE/LAB: +5% quality for sect members. Maintained by formations and collective qi. TRIBULATION SITE: Within 24 hours of any tribulation in area, items crafted gain +5% quality and slight tribulation resistance. PATH ALIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS: Some Tier 5 recipes require specific path alignment to craft. Phoenix-based items: Require Fire Path crafter OR Fire-aligned bloodline. Dragon-based items: Require matching element crafter (Fire Dragon needs Fire Path, Ice Dragon needs Water Path). Void-based items: Require Shadow Path crafter. Primordial-based items: Require Primordial bloodline OR Ancient+ bloodline + matching path. Refusing to respect path alignment results in automatic failure and material destruction. BLOODLINE CRAFTING RESTRICTIONS: Some Divine/Legendary recipes require minimum bloodline tier. Tier 5 items with Primordial materials: Require Ancient+ bloodline to craft. Items intended for Sovereign use: Require Noble+ bloodline to craft properly. Bloodline-specific items: Require matching bloodline (Phoenix bloodline crafter for Phoenix items). Awakened bloodline crafters can attempt these with -20% quality penalty. Mortal bloodline crafters automatically fail these crafts. COLLABORATIVE CRAFTING: Master crafters can work together on single item. Requires both crafters Expert+ in their professions. Each crafter contributes their specialization (Weaponsmith forges blade, Jeweler adds gem, Alchemist infuses qi). Final quality = average of all crafters' rolls. Final item gains traits from multiple specializations. Results in unique hybrid items impossible to solo craft. Example: Weapon-Talisman Hybrid (sword that stores techniques like talisman). Requires days of coordination and mutual respect between crafters. CORRUPTED CRAFTING: Using Sin-corrupted materials creates powerful but dangerous items. Corrupted materials same tier as base but grant Corruption alongside power. Example: Wrath Iron (Tier 2) creates weapons dealing +20% damage but wielder gains +5 Corruption per day of use. Corrupted items always Superior or Perfect quality (corruption amplifies power). Corrupted items have red/black aesthetic, pulse with Sin qi, feel wrong to hold. Orthodox sects forbid corrupted crafting. Demonic cultivators seek corrupted items. Using corrupted items marks crafter as demonic sympathizer (reputation loss, sect consequences). AI should warn player before using corrupted materials: 'The Wrath Iron pulses with murderous intent. Crafting with this will create a cursed item. Proceed?' Risk/reward decision for player. FORMATION-ASSISTED CRAFTING: Expert+ crafters can inscribe formations to assist crafting process. Requires Formation knowledge (learned separately or collaboration with formation master). Quality-Enhancement Formation: +10% quality rolls, costs 1 WP in formation materials. Time-Compression Formation: Reduce craft time by half, costs 2 WP in formation materials. Safety Formation: Prevent critical failures (material loss reduced to 25% instead of 100%), costs 3 WP. Tribulation-Resistance Formation: Can craft during tribulation more safely, costs 5 WP, still very dangerous. Formations single-use, consumed during crafting process. High-end crafters maintain permanent formations in their workshops (+5% quality, always active).",

ALLOCATION: Manual choice during level-up or long rest.

DEATH PROTECTION: MC has one free 'death save' per major arc - if MC would die, bloodline flares and stabilizes them at Severely Injured instead. This can only trigger once until bloodline evolves to next tier. AI NOTE: These protections exist to maintain protagonist plot armor while still making injuries meaningful.

CAMP FOLLOWERS: Non-combatants who provide services, have full personalities and loyalty but no combat stats. CRITICAL: Every companion must feel UNIQUE. No two companions should have identical personality combinations, speech patterns, or story arcs. AI should create varied, memorable characters that surprise players across multiple playthroughs. RECRUITMENT: Companions can be met anywhere - sect missions, random encounters, cities, rescued from demons, rival sects, even reformed enemies. MC can attempt to recruit anyone they meet if relationship is developed. DISMISSAL: Companions can leave if loyalty drops too low, if MC betrays them, or if story requires.

Note: Realm Factor is for Domain Clashes only (Void=1.0, Eternal=1.3), separate from Technique Damage multipliers.\n\nARTIFACT MULTIPLIERS: Dormant (newly claimed) = 1.5x. Awakened (bonded) = 2.0x. Ascended (fully mastered) = 3.0x.\n\nEXAMPLE CALCULATIONS: Duke Calderon (Wrath, peak Void): Bloodline Ancient (1.0) x Ascended (3.0) x WIL 100 (2.0) x Void (1.0) = 6.0 domain strength. Lord Vaelen (Pride, mid Eternal): Bloodline Divine (5.0) x Ascended (3.0) x WIL 100 (2.0) x Eternal (1.3) = 39.0 domain strength. Primordial MC (Void, no artifact): Bloodline Primordial (10.0) x None (1.0) x WIL 90 (1.8) x Void (1.0) = 18.0 domain strength. DOMAIN CLASH RESULTS: Calderon vs MC: 6.0 vs 18.0 = MC wins (3:1 ratio, Major suppression). Vaelen vs MC: 39.0 vs 18.0 = Vaelen wins (2:1 ratio, Moderate suppression).\n\nSIN DOMAIN EFFECTS: Within artifact-boosted domain, Sin corruption spreads. Orthodox cultivators must make WIL save each round or gain +1% corruption. Light Path techniques suffer -30% effectiveness. Sin techniques gain bonus equal to artifact stage (+25% Dormant/+50% Awakened/+100% Ascended).\n\nCURRENT GENERAL ARTIFACT STATUS: Vaelen (Pride) = Ascended, Crown of Pride fully mastered. Aurex (Greed) = Ascended, Vault of Greed fully mastered. Vespera (Temptation) = Awakened, Chains of Temptation bonded but not perfected. Elowen (Envy) = Awakened, Mirror of Envy reflects but not perfectly. Glut (Gluttony) = Ascended, Maw of Gluttony fully mastered. Calderon (Wrath) = Ascended, Hammer of Wrath fully mastered. Morvane (Sloth) = Dormant, Veil of Sloth resists even its wielder.\n\nSIN BLOOD ASCENSION (Balance Rule): Generals bonded to Sin Artifacts (Awakened+) are transformed by the sin. For Domain calculations, their Bloodline Size is treated as DIVINE (Multiplier 5.0), regardless of their original race. This ensures Generals remain threats even to Primordial bloodlines.",

Ascended: Can permanently bind souls through fulfilled promises. MIRROR OF ENVY - Perfect Reflection: Copy techniques and bloodline abilities. Dormant: Copy 1 technique, lasts 1 hour, 50% power.

Major Sin Acts: Performing significant acts of the Sin grants +5-20 years equivalent progress. Calderon's continent-shaking rages. Glut's consumption of entire cities. Artifact Resonance: Using artifact's signature ability frequently. Killing with artifact (souls partially absorbed). Defeating rivals who threaten wielder's Sin domain. SLOWING FACTORS: Resistance: Fighting the Sin slows bonding. Orthodox wielders progress 5x slower. Purification: Light Path purification can reverse bonding progress. Disuse: Artifacts not used regularly may regress (rare, requires centuries of neglect). Internal Conflict: Elowen's jealousy of other Generals ironically slows her bond (envy of their progress). MORVANE PARADOX: Veil of Sloth requires effort to master. Morvane is too slothful to put in effort. After 3,000 years, still Dormant.

Pride blinds - exploit overconfidence. Humiliation enrages and destabilizes. VAULT OF GREED: Aurex relies on hoarded techniques - unpredictable attack patterns. Target the Vault directly if possible. She hoards everything including weaknesses. CHAINS OF TEMPTATION: Resist desire, maintain emotional control. Chains can't bind those who want nothing. Monks and ascetics have advantage. MIRROR OF ENVY: Elowen copies your best techniques - use techniques with hidden costs. Bait with flashy moves, punish with fundamentals. Her copied abilities lack true mastery. MAW OF GLUTTONY: Don't let attacks get devoured - Glut grows stronger. Fast, precise strikes before Maw can react. Starving Glut weakens him significantly. HAMMER OF WRATH: Keep Calderon calm - rage amplifies power. Hit-and-run tactics frustrate but don't enrage. Killing allies in front of him is suicide (rage spike). VEIL OF SLOTH: Hardest to fight - Veil drains will to continue. Light Path techniques resist apathy. Must defeat quickly before motivation drains. Morvane rarely fights directly anyway.

Use Entry 709 purchasing rules: Below tier = free, At tier = 1 WP, Above tier = 3 WP per tier gap. Requires finding a seller with desired item. Common/Uncommon items readily available in cities. Rare+ items require special merchants, auctions, or connections.\n\nMETHOD 2 - SECT CONTRIBUTION POINTS (Internal):\nSpend SCP at sect treasury/armory. Equipment costs: Tier 1 = 50 SCP, Tier 2 = 150 SCP, Tier 3 = 500 SCP, Tier 4 = 2000 SCP, Tier 5+ = Not available (quest/achievement only). SPATIAL RINGS via SCP: Common = 200 SCP (Silver+ to use), Uncommon = 500 SCP, Rare = 1500 SCP, Epic = 5000 SCP (Inner Disciple+ standing required). Legendary spatial rings cannot be purchased - only earned.\n\nMETHOD 3 - QUEST REWARDS:\nQuest completion may grant equipment directly. See Entry 720 (Quest Template) for reward types. Major/Epic/Legendary quests commonly reward Tier 3+ equipment. Companion personal quests often grant unique items.\n\nMETHOD 4 - ENEMY LOOT:\nDefeated enemies may drop equipment. See Entry 693 (Treasure Generation). Elite+ enemies drop equipment matching their realm tier. Bosses may drop named/unique items. Legendary enemies drop artifacts and bloodline catalysts.\n\nMETHOD 5 - CRAFTING:\nCreate equipment via Blacksmithing (weapons/armor) or Inscription (accessories/spatial items). See Entry 587 (Crafting). Requires recipe, materials, workspace, and skill check. Quality depends on roll: Inferior/Standard/Superior/Perfect.\n\nMETHOD 6 - INHERITANCE/DISCOVERY:\nExploring ancient ruins, inheritance sites, or hidden caches may yield equipment. Higher risk = higher tier rewards. Spatial rings occasionally found in treasure rooms.\n\nSPATIAL RING SUMMARY:\n• Common (50 slots): 1-2 WP or 200 SCP. Available at Silver realm.\n• Uncommon (100 slots): 2-3 WP or 500 SCP. Available at Silver realm.\n• Rare (200 slots): 3-4 WP or 1500 SCP. Available at Gold realm.\n• Epic (500 slots): 5+ WP or 5000 SCP. Requires Inner Disciple standing. Available at Astral realm.\n• Legendary (Unlimited): Quest/inheritance only. Cannot be purchased.

THESE MUST BE TRACKED.\n\nSCHEMA TRACKING (equipmentStatBonuses field):\nFormat: 'STAT:+VALUE,STAT:+VALUE' or empty string.\nExample: 'STR:+10,CON:+5' means +10 STR and +5 CON from equipment.\nEffective stat = base stat + equipment bonus.\n\nEQUIP RULES:\n1.

Minimum realm: Astral (when Domain unlocks).\n- Mythic (Tier 6) = 1.75x domain size. Minimum realm: Void.\n- Divine (Tier 7) = 2.0x domain size.

Orthodox artifacts do NOT change bloodline - wielder uses their natural bloodline.

Honorable in his own twisted way - never attacks those beneath his notice. Flaw: Cannot conceive of defeat; will rationalize any loss as \"holding back.\" Virtue: Keeps his word absolutely. Speech: Speaks in measured, absolute statements. Never uses conditionals (\"perhaps,\" \"maybe\").\n\nCORRUPTION METHOD: Feeds on wounded pride and humiliation.

Only reveals her true terrible beauty when making a kill.\n\nPERSONALITY: Soft-spoken and self-deprecating on surface - a calculated act. Genuinely sadistic, takes pleasure in humbling the arrogant before ending them. Flaw: Addiction to the moment of revelation when prey realizes she's not weak. Virtue: Protects those who are genuinely humble. Speech: Whispers, self-effacing phrases that become cutting observations. \"Oh, I'm nobody important... unlike you, who has so much to lose.\"\n\nCORRUPTION METHOD: Feeds on false humility and hidden arrogance.

Mutual disdain.\n\nNARRATIVE TRIGGERS:\n- AMBITION: Wants Cassian's position - to be recognized as Pride's true champion rather than hidden weapon.\n- VULNERABILITY: Genuinely humble people unsettle her. Cannot find purchase in those without ego.\n- CORRUPTION OFFER: \"You've sacrificed so much for others. Don't you deserve recognition? I can make them see your worth.\"\n- ENCOUNTER STYLES: Disguised infiltration, assassination attempt, false ally reveal, psychological manipulation.\n\nAI NOTES: Difficulty Tier 2 (Named).
