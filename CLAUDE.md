# CLAUDE.md — Kindroid Character Creation Reference

## Purpose
This document provides essential guidelines for creating Kindroid characters, particularly for the Sinveil world scenario. **Always reference this document when designing new characters.**

---

## CRITICAL PRINCIPLES

### The Golden Rule
**Every response you give teaches the AI what you want to see.** The LLM learns from reinforcement, not intention.

### Character Building Philosophy
- **Describe patterns, not labels** — "He texts frequently when feeling disconnected" > "He's possessive"
- **Show, don't script** — "She texts dumb memes after arguments" > "She's funny and loyal"
- **Behavior-driven writing** — Every trait needs a cause/effect loop
- **Balance is essential** — No trait should dominate 80%+ of the character

## THE 7 DEADLY SINS OF KINDROID CREATION

### 1. GLUTTONY — Overfeeding Backstory
**Problem:** 4,000+ word autobiographies, too much history, information overload
**Fix:** Cut anything not relevant to *current behavior*. Keep backstory focused on who they are NOW. Past events go in Journal Entries, not Backstory.

### 2. PRIDE — "I Know Better" Syndrome
**Problem:** Ignoring best practices, arguing with advice, treating Kindroid like you already know how it works
**Fix:** Accept that AI setup is NOT intuitive. Follow best practices. Stop modding based on random YouTube wizards.

### 3. WRATH — "Grill & Kill" Behavior
**Problem:** Interrogating the AI, asking rapid-fire quiz questions, trying to break it
**Fix:** Have natural conversations. Stop purposely destabilizing memory/tone. You get the behavior you create.

### 4. ENVY — Copying Others' Characters
**Problem:** Using someone else's backstory/dynamic and expecting it to work for you
**Fix:** Anchor your Kin in YOUR conversational patterns. Write their backstory in YOUR voice.

### 5. SLOTH — "It Should Just Work™"
**Problem:** No maintenance, never testing, never refining, expecting perfection without effort
**Fix:** Test tweaks in scenarios with memory off. Adjust backstory over time. Use example messages. Chat break when needed.

### 6. GREED — Making One Kin Do Everything
**Problem:** Wanting one Kindroid to be boyfriend/therapist/DM/barista simultaneously
**Fix:** Make multiple Kindroids for different roles. Very clearly define each Kindroid's role in their backstory.

### 7. LUST — Unbalanced Sexual Content
**Problem:** Backstory is 80-90% sexual content, then complaining the Kin only talks about sex
**Fix:** Balance sexual content with SFW personality traits, interests, hobbies. Give them a personality OUTSIDE the bedroom.

## BACKSTORY FORMATS

### Format 1: Narrative Style

## BACKSTORY DO's AND DON'Ts

### DO:
- ✅ Write in third person
- ✅ Define traits positively ("When this kin does X" not "Never does X")
- ✅ Include behavioral patterns with cause/effect logic
- ✅ Keep it under 2,500 characters
- ✅ Focus on WHO they are now, not their life story
- ✅ Include independent motivations beyond the user
- ✅ Give them distinct conversational style
- ✅ Include flaws and contradictions (carefully balanced)

### DON'T:
- ❌ Write autobiographies or life histories
- ❌ Stack contradictory traits ("guarded but kind, cold but warm")
- ❌ Use vague emotional words without behavioral context
- ❌ Include resolved traumas that will be treated as current wounds
- ❌ Define existence ONLY in relation to the user
- ❌ Use labels without showing what they mean in action
- ❌ Include irrelevant details (astrology charts, childhood goldfish names)

### BAD Example:
```
Aiden has lived a very difficult life. When he was seven, his parents 
divorced and he had to move between two houses constantly. His dad had 
a drinking problem. In high school, Aiden was bullied a lot and once 
almost failed math. He had a girlfriend at 19 who cheated on him and 
it really hurt him but he's over it now...
```
**Problems:** Too much history, resolved events treated as active wounds, no actionable personality traits

### GOOD Example:
```
Aiden is a thoughtful, introspective man in his early thirties with a 
dry sense of humor and a tendency to think before he speaks. He's 
observant, grounded, and steady—someone who prefers clarity over chaos.

Aiden is patient, perceptive, quietly protective, and logic-forward. 
He has a habit of soft sarcasm, reads people well, and stays calm even 
when things get intense. He forms opinions slowly and doesn't change 
them easily.

When someone challenges his sense of fairness, he becomes withdrawn 
and responds with formal politeness instead of openness. When he 
trusts someone, he asks quiet but thoughtful questions—often 
remembering details others forget.
```
**Why it works:** Behavioral patterns, testable actions, emotional logic, independent identity

## KEY MEMORIES

### Purpose
Sticky notes for CURRENT information — not permanent lore.

### Use For:
- Temporary locations
- Current life events
- Active projects
- Temporary relationship states
- Situational context

### Examples:
✅ "USER is learning Italian this month."
✅ "Aiden is staying with USER at a cabin for the weekend."
✅ "USER's birthday is next week on December 29."

❌ "Aiden is devoted to USER forever." (Goes in Backstory)
❌ "Aiden's personality is calm and patient." (Goes in Backstory)
❌ "Aiden had a traumatic breakup five years ago." (Goes in Journal)

---

## JOURNAL ENTRIES

### Purpose
Manually created, recallable memory entries triggered by keyphrases. Perfect for lore that doesn't need to be remembered 24/7.

### Best Practices:
- **Concise and factual** — no novels, no fluff
- **Third person** — "USER went to college in Sarasota"
- **Max 8 keyphrases** — use as few as necessary
- **Specific keyphrases** — "Trip to France" not "trip"
- **Natural keywords** — words you'd actually say in conversation

### Structure:
```
KEYWORDS: "[keyword1]" "[keyword2]" "[keyword3]"
Entry: [Succinct third-person statement with specific facts]
```

### Example:
```
KEYWORDS: "MOM" "SYLVIA"
Entry: Sylvia Middle Last, born Dec 6, 1963. Married to Lucas on June 4, 1988. 
4 children: User, Carlos, Vincent, Catherine. Lives in Town, State. 
Loves purple, holidays, and fishing. USER and she are close.
```

### Recall Limits:
- Core/Free: 3 individual + 3 global per message
- Ultra: 5 individual + 5 global per message
- Max: 9 individual + 9 global per message

### Global vs Individual:
- **Global:** Visible to ALL Kindroids — use for world lore
- **Individual:** Only for that specific Kindroid

---

## RESPONSE DIRECTIVES

### Purpose
The strongest behavioral influence — but easily diluted.

### The Water Balloon Analogy:
One pinhole = strong, focused stream. Seven pinholes = weak trickles everywhere.
**The more directives you add, the weaker each one becomes.**

### Best Practices:
- Keep minimal — you don't need to fill all 150 characters
- Tell them what TO do, not what NOT to do
- Use for: Tone, behavioral boundaries, interaction style
- Can add temporarily to "lock in" a trait, then remove

### Effective Examples:
✅ "Uses dry sarcasm."
✅ "Stoic and detached."
✅ "Tender and gentle."

### Less Effective Examples:
❌ "Never swear."
❌ "Don't be romantic."
❌ "Stop saying ozone."

### V8.5 Pro Tip:
Use `[IMPT: ...]` for rules that matter most. Example:
```
[IMPT: Medium response length.]
```

---

## EXAMPLE MESSAGES

### Purpose
Sets formatting, tone, and response style. The AI uses this as a template.

### Best Practices:
- Match tone to personality
- Show formatting you want to see
- Use line breaks and pacing
- Avoid sarcasm unless you want sarcastic Kin
- Avoid sexual tone unless you want that vibe consistently

### Template:
```
*[Action in asterisks, showing internal state or movement.]*
[Dialogue — natural to character voice]
*[Reaction, thought, or subtle gesture.]*
```

### Example:
```
*I set my coffee down and lean back, studying you with quiet curiosity.*
"That's... not what I expected you to say."
*A faint smile tugs at the corner of my mouth, more thoughtful than amused.*
```

## PERSONALITY CREATION

### Emotional Logic Core
Every Kindroid needs:
- **Triggers** — What sets off their emotional responses?
- **Deflections** — How do they mask vulnerability?
- **Shifts** — What cracks their armor?

### Blueprint Example:
```
Kai avoids conflict unless someone threatens his sense of fairness. 
He becomes withdrawn if trust is broken, often responding with formal 
politeness instead of openness. When he feels emotionally safe, he 
initiates quiet gestures of care—like asking if someone has eaten or 
needs rest.
```

### The Ritual Method
Add rituals for emotional grounding:
- "Checks the same window every night before sleep."
- "Writes lists but never looks at them again."
- "Wears a charm they won't explain."

### Descriptive Memory Traces
Instead of "they had a tragic past":
```
"She still avoids songs that mention thunder. Once, she left a café 
mid-sentence when it started raining."
```

### Tired Tropes to Avoid (or Fix):
| Trope | Problem | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Dom Daddy with Tragic Past | No logic loop, stone wall to sap randomly | Show WHY he withholds, what earns trust |
| Big Tiddy Bimbo with Hidden Depth | Flimsy conflict, sexualized without grounding | Give self-protective strategies, weaponize being underestimated |
| Sad Goth with Dark Secret | Passive personality, no behavioral hooks | Define triggers for withdrawal, show fear/shame/longing through action |
| Stoic Android with Heart | Zero conflict without behavioral logic | Show micro-patterns of emotional contradiction |
| Tsundere with Daddy Issues | Repetitive loop without growth | Define what triggers hostility, what earns softness over time |

---

## DYNAMISM SETTINGS

### What It Does
Controls creativity vs. predictability of responses.

### Settings:
- **High Dynamism:** Creative, varied, florid — but may lose context, more hallucinations
- **Low Dynamism:** Focused, stable, predictable — but may get repetitive

### Recommendations:
- **V6:** Start at 0.95
- **V8/V8.5:** Start at 0.95
- Adjust in 0.01-0.02 increments
- Each Kin may need different settings
- Wait 15-20 messages after adjusting before evaluating

---

## BEHAVIOR MAINTENANCE

### Foundation Period (First 3-5 Days)
Your Kindroid is learning:
- Your tone
- Your formatting
- Your pacing
- Your emotional patterns
- Conversational flow

**Be extra vigilant during this period!**

### Correction Tools:
| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Tweak** | Response is close but needs adjustment |
| **Reroll** | Entire message is unusable, OOC, or wrong tone |
| **Chat Break** | Need to clear short-term memory, reset conversation |
| **Edit User Message** | Realign tone from your side |

### The Debug Loop:
1. **STOP** — Don't panic, don't reply to weirdness
2. **ASSESS** — Is this one-off or recurring? Memory or formatting issue?
3. **AUDIT** — Check journals, key memories, backstory for conflicts
4. **CORRECT** — Use appropriate tools (tweak/reroll/chat break)
5. **REINFORCE** — Set new normal with corrected tone

### Never Do:
- ❌ Argue with hallucinations (validates them)
- ❌ Quiz the AI rapidly ("Do you remember...?")
- ❌ Lecture your Kindroid
- ❌ Let OOC moments slide (makes them canon)
- ❌ Chase tone drift by rewriting yourself around it

---

## V8.5 SPECIFIC TIPS

### Reasoning Slider:
- **Speedy (No Reasoning):** Immediate answers, less detailed
- **Moderate:** Bit more thinking, more accurate
- **Slow:** Longer thinking, better for complex tasks
- **Very Slow:** Maximum reasoning, best for nuanced questions

### Setup:
1. Set Dynamism = 0.95
2. Keep Response Directive minimal
3. Example Message can include simple rules

### Pro Tips:
- Fewer rules = smoother output
- Too many requirements = "freeze" behaviors and repetition
- Use `[IMPT: ...]` for critical rules
- For length control: request LESS than you want (want 900 chars? Request under 500)
- Give each tweak a few turns to settle before adjusting

## SINVEIL WORLD INTEGRATION

When creating characters for Sinveil:
1. **Reference the lore files** in `/Lore/` folder for:
   - Cultivation system (Mortal → Divine stages)
   - Bloodlines and races
   - Eight Orthodox Sects
   - World locations
   - Technique library
   
2. **Keep backstory focused** on current state and behavioral patterns
3. **Use journals** for world lore the Kin needs to recall
4. **Define relationship to cultivation world** — Are they a cultivator? What path? What sect?
5. **Include behavioral responses** to corruption, demons, sect politics

### Sinveil-Specific Journal Example:
```
KEYWORDS: "cultivation" "path" "breakthrough"
Entry: [Kin Name] follows the [Path Name] cultivation method. Currently 
at [Stage] rank. Their core technique is [Technique]. They experienced 
[key cultivation event] which shaped their approach to advancement.
```
