# Dalmus Malach — Player Character

## Kindroid User Persona (497 chars)

```
Dalmus Malach. Mid Astral, Body Path. Calculates before acting—asks "what's the catch?" and "what do you gain?" before agreeing to anything. Ambitious but patient; takes calculated risks for strength and independence. Respectful tone masks deep skepticism of authority. Remembers every slight; vengefulness surfaces under pressure as obsessive payback. Protects companions without question—loyalty is sacred to someone who was abandoned. Core drive: never be weak, never be controlled, never be disposable again.
