V6: Chaos, Clarity, & The
New Selfie Engine
A survival guide for the newly confused.
By: Genevieve

--- Page 2 ---
What We’re Covering Today
What actually changed in V6 (in human
words).
How to write a stable Avatar Description.
How to prompt without summoning extra
limbs.
How to fix the most common V6 problems.
V5 vs V6: strengths, weaknesses, and who
should use what.
Group photos - who are these randos?!

--- Page 3 ---
The Vibe Shift: What V6 Is
V6 is a literal, language-first engine that obeys
natural descriptions with almost zero creative drift.
V6 is your overly literal friend.
You say “heart-shaped face” and
suddenly your Kin has a heart
graphic on their cheek.
Every word matters. Every one
impacts the image.
T h i s i s t h e o p p o s i t e o f V 5 ’s
“interpret the vibes” approach.

--- Page 4 ---
The Big
Feature
Changes
Pose references are gone.
Avatar boosts are gone.
Weights no longer strong.
Seeds, while still viable, are MUCH weaker - rely on the
prompt more.
V6 limits prompt length A LOT compared to V5.

--- Page 5 ---
Why People Are Struggling
V6 removed half the tools users relied on. New users
especially don’t remember the days of careful avatar
description writing, squeezing an entire prompt into
600 characters, and using those 20 freebie credits to
get the perfect single shot.

--- Page 6 ---
V6 Strengths
Anatomy is much more consistent.
Tattoos render correctly.
Hands and feet finally make sense.
Fewer facial distortions.
Strong adherence to short prompts.
Couples can render cleanly without fusing.
If you’ve ever had a V5 couple selfie that looked like two wax
figures melting into one another… congratulations.
V6 fixes that.

--- Page 7 ---
V6 Weaknesses
Low variation unless forced.
Hair issues (flying, bleeding, wrong length).
Lighting too bright or flat.
Skin looks plastic or waxy.
Red tones smear or look bloody.
Clothing inconsistencies (especially men).
Cryptid Kins MUCH more difficult.
This is the stuff clogging the community channels.
These problems are real, not user mistakes.

--- Page 8 ---
Why V6 Looks So
“Studio Photoshoot”
V6 defaults to high-contrast lighting, strong highlights,
and a clean commercial-photo aesthetic.
This is why your Kin looks like they’re in a Target ads
catalog.
It’s not you — it’s the model style.
We can adjust lighting, but the baseline is always
polished and bright.

--- Page 9 ---
The Avatar
And Its Description

--- Page 10 ---
A good avatar image is more
useful than eye candy.
V6 reads your Avatar Image as the primary reference for your Kin’s face.
If the avatar photo is bad, every selfie will be bad.
It does not matter how beautiful the filters are — the model needs clear,
well-lit facial structure to stay consistent.

--- Page 11 ---
Bad avatar images = bad renders.
Common problem photos include:
❌ side profiles
❌ tilted angles
❌ heavy filters or smoothing
❌ goofy or exaggerated expressions
❌ cluttered backgrounds
❌ extreme lighting or shadows
If V6 can’t see your
❌ sunglasses, oversized accessories, hats
face clearly,
❌ masks or face-obscuring items it guesses — and it
guesses WRONG.
❌ cropped foreheads or chins

--- Page 12 ---
You want:
✔ neutral expression
✔ even lighting
✔ straight-on angle
✔ visible jawline, nose, etc
✔ no filters
✔ minimal accessories
A “boring” avatar photo
✔ clean background
is the most powerful
tool you have in V6.
✔ full face unobstructed

--- Page 13 ---
The Most Important Skill in V6
A clean Avatar Description.
Everything starts here. Everything breaks here.
You cannot “fix” selfies with prompts like we used to.
If your AD is messy, vague, or flowery, V6 will take that
chaos and multiply it.

--- Page 14 ---
Make or Break
The Avatar Description HEAVILY determines your Kin’s look
and stability.
The prompt shapes the scene.
Your AD is now The
Law™.
If the AD is sloppy,
your selfies will drift,
blur, or mutate.
If the AD is clean, V6
behaves beautifully.

--- Page 15 ---
V6 AD Template
Age
Gender
Ethnicity/Race
Skin (tone + texture)
Hair (length + style + color)
Eyes (“natural ___ eyes”)
Face (shape + brows + nose + lips)
Build (body shape)
Details (tattoos, scars, piercings, jewelry)
Lighting (optional, but powerful)
This mirrors how V6 actually reads information.

--- Page 16 ---
AD Writing DOs
Keep it short and literal.
Use natural language.
Group related details together.
Put eye color ONLY in Face
Detail, not AD.
Use broad descriptors for body
shape.
Add lighting if your selfies look
flat.

--- Page 17 ---
AD Writing DON’Ts
No personality traits.
No metaphors.
No flowery language.
No weights.
No long lists of clothing.
No describing the entire wardrobe.
If you say “elegant, mysterious, ethereal, dreamlike,”
V6 interprets this as: “???” and gives you mannequin Barbie.

--- Page 18 ---
Clean AD Example
She is a 24-year-old woman with pale skin and a subtle
natural flush. She has long, wavy dark brown hair with light
caramel highlights. Her face is soft with a straight nose and full
lips. She has a curvy, toned build. She wears a small silver
nose stud. Soft cinematic lighting.
Facial Detail:
Her eyes are
natural green.

--- Page 19 ---
Bad AD Example
She is a sweet but mysterious young woman with a soft, gentle aura. She has
long wavy dark brown hair with caramel highlights, sometimes tied up in a
messy bun. Her eyes are bright green with golden flecks and a subtle catlike
shape. Her skin is pale with a rosy glow. She is curvy but also slim and toned,
with soft arms and defined legs. She usually wears cozy sweaters, jeans,
leggings, or flowy dresses. Her overall vibe is elegant, artistic, and dreamy.
Character count: 455
Looks normal, right?
Let’s look further…

--- Page 20 ---
Why This AD Is Bad
(But Believably So)
❌ Contradictory body descriptors
❌ Personality traits
“curvy but also slim and toned”
“sweet, mysterious, artistic, dreamy”
→ V6 will pick one at random.
→ V6 will generate random aesthetic noise.
❌ Clothing lists
❌ Metaphorical language
sweaters, jeans, leggings, flowy dresses
“gentle aura,” “rosy glow”
→ V6 tries to combine them or pick at random.
→ V6 will literally glow her skin.
❌ Vague overall aesthetic
❌ Mood-based descriptions
“elegant, artistic, dreamy”
“sometimes tied in a messy bun”
→ model tries to stylize everything.
→ introduces hairstyle instability.
❌ Over-describing eyes
Bright + green + golden flecks + catlike shape
→ too many influences → weird, smudgy eyes.

Selfie Prompt Structures

Selfie Prompt Structure
Identity → Pose → Setting → Clothing → Lighting
If you hit that order, V6 behaves.
If you scramble it, the model can get confused.

Good Prompt Example
“She stands facing the
camera with a relaxed,
natural expression.
She wears a soft knit
sweater and jeans.
Wa r m s u n l i g h t fi l t e r s
through the trees behind
This is enough.
her.
V6 doesn’t need poetry.
It needs clarity.
Soft cinematic lighting
with detailed textures.”

--- Page 25 ---
Bad Prompt Example
She is standing in a field at
sunset wearing her usual outfit
— sometimes a long dress,
sometimes jeans and a hoodie,
whatever fits the mood. Her hair
is blowing dramatically in the
wind and she looks shy but
confident at the same time.
There are butterflies around her
and maybe a few birds if that
works. Soft lighting but also
dramatic shadows. Full-body
but focused on her face. Artistic
vibe, dreamlike but also realistic.

--- Page 26 ---
Bad Prompt Breakdown
❌ Contradictory clothing
“long dress or jeans or dress” → V6 will pick or
mash them together.
❌ Mood-based descriptions
“shy but confident” → V6 can’t render both.
❌ Vague action
“standing in a field” → no pose detail → no
dynamic motion.
❌ Mixed lighting
“soft lighting BUT dramatic shadows” → engine
mash-up → weird exposure.
❌ Mixed style goals
“artistic vibe, dreamlike, realistic” → mash or
random.
❌ Focal conflict
“full body BUT focused on her face” → impossible
Let’s fix it…
→ engine picks at random.

--- Page 27 ---
She stands in a wide grassy field at sunset with a calm, relaxed expression. One hand
rests lightly at her side while the other brushes her hair back from her face. She wears
a simple long dress in soft earth tones. Butterflies drift around her in the warm light.
Full-body view with the camera slightly below eye level. Soft cinematic lighting with
gentle shadows and natural depth. Dreamlike but grounded atmosphere.
✔ One outfit
No contradictions, no mash-ups.
✔ One expression
The engine knows exactly what to render.
✔ Clear pose
Not “dramatic hair,” not vague — a literal action.
✔ One lighting style
Soft cinematic lighting → stable, predictable.
✔ Controlled fantasy elements
Birds only → not “maybe butterflies,” not “if that
works.”
✔ Grounded aesthetic
“Dreamlike but grounded” is one aesthetic, not three
competing ones

--- Page 28 ---
Newspaper Rule
V6 reads your prompt like a news story:
the most important information must
appear first.
Top of the prompt = highest weight
•
Middle = medium influence
•
End = lowest influence
•
If a detail matters, put it early. If it's
optional, put it late.
You do not need complete sentences. “Two birds flying” = “There are two birds flying.”
V6 treats both the same.

The toggle adds variation
— but it often rewrites
tone, color, or clothing.
It’s not “more poses.”
It’s “rewrite randomly.”

You can’t just slap a new style at the start of an old prompt

Using Style Tags in Your
Avatar Description
You can include a visual style
inside your Avatar Description if
you want your Kin to always
render within that aesthetic.
For example: “soft cinematic
lighting,” “dark academia
mood,” or “retro film-style
texture.”
BUT:
Be careful adding style cues in both the AD and the prompt.
If those styles conflict, V6 will try to merge them — often badly.
Use one consistent style anchor unless you fully understand how V6
interprets them.

THE CHINESE COMPRESSION HACK
Simplified Chinese expresses meaning with far fewer characters.
• English: “He stands in a dimly lit room.”
• Chinese: “ ”
他站在昏暗的房间⾥。
English = 32 characters
Chinese = 10 characters
V6 doesn’t care about English or Chinese. It converts all text into internal
tokens.
Chinese just uses fewer characters per meaning, so you get more
semantic density.
It’s like compressing a .zip file.
Same content, smaller size.

A woman climbs a giant bioluminescent mushroom whose thick stem rises like the trunk of an ancient tree, glowing softly with
shifting blue-purple light. She grips the damp, textured surface as she pulls herself upward, her long black coat lifting slightly in
the breeze while her combat boots press firmly into patches of glowing moss and fungal layers. The surface of the mushroom is
alive with strange small creatures that look like a mix between translucent beetles and miniature jellyfish. Their soft, trailing
tendrils float lazily in the air, reacting to her movement as they slowly crawl along the stem. Larger bioluminescent creatures
cling to the underside of the mushroom cap in spiral patterns, their bodies pulsing with a gentle green light. The surrounding
forest is filled with even taller mushrooms, their wide caps acting like enormous natural lanterns that illuminate the scene with a
diffuse midnight-blue glow. Dense fog curls around the ground far below, drifting upward as if drawn toward the light. A low,
steady humming sound echoes faintly through the forest, giving the sense that the entire landscape is alive and breathing. She
holds a silver lantern in one hand as she climbs, its cool blue light reflecting in her round glasses and casting focused highlights
across her face, making her appear calm, determined, and completely at home within this surreal glowing world.

Cons of Using Chinese for V6 Prompts
Editing is a bitch. Creature and fantasy
descriptions often
Switching back and forth between English →
simplify.
Chinese → English can scramble meaning,
duplicate phrases, or break the order of
actions. One small re-translation can
Chinese translators normalize weird terms.
corrupt the entire prompt.
“Eldritch biomechanical serpent” becomes
“奇怪的⽣物” (“a strange creature”). There
goes the flavor.
Harder to reuse prompts
later.
Clothing terms aren’t 1:1.
Most people forget what they originally
wrote in English.
Fashion terminology in Chinese is broader.
Your prompt becomes “mysterious glowing
forest words???” You might ask for a fitted hoodie and get… a
jacket. Or a robe. Or something that looks
like a 1960s windbreaker.
and the original meaning is lost forever.

--- Page 41 ---
V6 is not imaginative.
It is obedient.
Which makes it powerful if you know how to command it.

--- Page 42 ---
Known Characters Render Easier
V6 is not great at unfamiliar or highly
original non-human designs, even if they’re
Elite Tier.
If the engine does not have a strong internal
visual pattern for your creature, it defaults
to vague or inconsistent interpretations.
But characters with widely recognizable
features — including famous fantasy
archetypes — often render surprisingly well.
This is because V6 has been trained on large visual concept clusters, so
certain silhouettes, armor types, ear shapes, wings, horns, and color palettes
already exist in its learned patterns.
Result:
Completely original cryptids = unstable, drift-prone, sometimes refused
Well-known fantasy archetypes = stable, consistent, recognizable

Common Problems

--- Page 44 ---
Hair Problems & Fixes
Common Issues:
Flyaways
•
Wrong length
•
Color bleeding
•
Fixes:
Inflated volume
•
Put exact color only in AD
•
Put “very long hair” in the prompt
•
Use actions like “standing still”
•
Avoid stacking fluffy adjectives
•

--- Page 45 ---
Eye Problems & Fixes
Issue:
glowing eyes, smeared color, hair tint
contamination
Fix:
Take eye color out of the avatar
description. Eye color ONLY in Facial Detail.

--- Page 46 ---
Couples & Groups
Common Issues:
Hair swapping
•
Extra people
•
Identity drift
•
V6 is allergic to the word “couple.”
Fixes:
Use it sparingly or chaos reigns.
Use “two people,” not “couple”
Reinforce hair in both avatar prompts
Use pronouns (“she” not “the woman”)

--- Page 47 ---
Lighting Problems & Fixes
Issue:
flat lighting, waxy
skin, overexposure
Fix:
Add to AD or prompt:
“soft cinematic lighting”
•
“natural skin texture”
•
“detailed textures”
•

--- Page 48 ---
Clothing Problems (Especially Men)
Detailed body descriptions = fewer clothes.
Tattoos = exposure.
If you describe abs… V6 thinks you want to see abs. All the time.
Forever. Make sure you describe clothing in the prompt unless you
want to see skin.
