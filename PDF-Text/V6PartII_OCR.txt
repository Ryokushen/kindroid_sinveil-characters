V6 Selfies Part II
Stable Bodies, Hair, and Physical Features
By: Genevieve

--- Page 2 ---
Last time was about the engine.
This week is about the body.
Users are struggling with:
Changing weight
•
Changing faces
•
Hair instability
•
Clothing unpredictability
•
This is a simplified version of a nonlinear process. In real time, you’ll loop, test, and
adjust constantly — but this staircase helps you see the order of decisions.

--- Page 3 ---
V6 Is Not Imaginative.
Its Obedient.
The smallest physical word becomes law.
If you give it options, V6 picks randomly.

--- Page 4 ---
A very fat woman with
long, layered lilac hair. She
has a very round face

--- Page 5 ---
A lanky man whose body is
very thin with long limbs
and knobby fingers. He has
a bald head.

--- Page 6 ---
A very tall and slender
Ghanan woman with a
wide nose, a long face,
and very dark eyes
Adding “Ghanan woman” to each
prompt emphasized skin tone.

Kin keeps changing body style
Body changes → simplify build
The more information you have in a
request, the more likely it is to just “pick
one and run with it”. In one selfie it might
focus on “Muscular” and get a himbo. In
the next it focuses on “Athletic” and get
a swimmer’s physique.
Experiment with a single descriptor at a
time until you land on one that gives the
result you want. The thesaurus is you
friend here.
And remember - plus sized kins who
don’t have plus sized faces can look like
they have tiny heads!

One Strong Descriptor
>
Many stacked ones
Try:
“curvy”
“slender”
“athletic build”
Wrong:
“Fat and curvy but toned with soft arms and a belly pooch.”

--- Page 10 ---
He is a very thin, gaunt, lanky, wispy
man with very long arms and legs.
Gaunt Lanky Wispy
Shirtless and dead, Most true to the Inserted a lil
haunted face Avatar Photo ghost friend
The engine will pick a descriptor at random and rarely the same one consecutively.

--- Page 11 ---
You CAN and often will use
more than one
But know what each is doing to your kin before you stack them

Hair keeps changing length
Hair drift → unify hair description in AD and prompt
If your kin’s hairstyle keeps
changing, reiterate it in the
prompt as well as in the
avatar description.
A d d i t i o n a l l y , c h e c k a l l
prompts to make sure there
a r e n o h i d d e n h a i r
descriptors that can skew
your results. This happens
more than you think!

Hair Is a Three-Part System
V6 treats hair as:
Length
•
Shape
•
Color
•
Reiterating the
hairstyle/color in the
prompt itself
increases consistency.
Short, spiky black Pixie cut

--- Page 14 ---
Split dye long
Waist length Full, dark silk press with
honey colored brown natural black on the
box braids afro left and white
on the right

--- Page 15 ---
The Hair Stability Rule
Fixed hair traits in the Avatar Description.
The prompt should describe motion.
Brown hair whipping
wildly in the wind
Her waist length
Her lavender hair
honey colored box
flies around her
braids fly around her

Safe vs Unsafe Face
Details
Safe:
“soft lips”
•
“straight nose”
•
“defined brows”
•
Foxlike eyes = fox ears
Danger:
“foxlike eyes,” “catlike eyes,” “sharp, mischievous smile”

--- Page 17 ---
Eye Description Placement Matters
Glowing yellow eyes Glowing orange eyes Very pale blue eyes
INSIDE avatar description inside AD in FACE DETAIL
causes color bleed
on humans
Also - having eye descriptors in the facial detail space can
reduce blur on faces.

--- Page 18 ---
Clothing vs. Anatomy:
The Hidden Fight
If you describe anatomy too much, V6 prioritizes BODY over CLOTHES.
If you describe:
Abs → crop tops
•
Broad chest → open shirts
•
Detailed boobs → topless
•
Long legs → cropped pants
•
Tattoos → visible regardless
•

--- Page 19 ---
Give a clothing modifier in the Avatar Description
AD: Dresses like a stuffy librarian AD: Always wears arm and
wrist bands
AD: Always wears white

--- Page 20 ---
Clothing keeps disappearing
Clothing issues → move body details out of AD OR
add a clothing modifier into it.
Overly describing body parts,
tattoos, piercings, beauty
marks, etc tells the selfie
engine that these are features
you want to see. Otherwise
why would you be describing
them?
If you HAVE to have one in,
give it a modifier. “He has a
chiseled chest hidden by dark
cotton t-shirts”.

--- Page 21 ---
Speaking of Tattoos
If they look like this
But you want this
Try “Faded black and grey tattoo” in your avatar description.

--- Page 22 ---
Trouble With Skin Tone Drift
Lighting modifiers in your avatar description or in certain prompts can wash
out some skin tones, making them look lighter.
Just like with hair, reiterate skin tone in your prompts to drive the correct
shade home.

--- Page 23 ---
Face Looks Different in
Every Selfie
Face drift → remove poetic details
V6 does not do its best work with
V5 style avatar descriptions.
Make sure you’ve taken out all of
the flowery language, the overly
narrative descriptions, etc. Bare
bones it.
Additionally, just like V5 you can
lower the Facial Detail slider to
encourage the engine to adhere
to the AD and image more closely.

Make sure your prompts reflect your individual kin
A pale, gaunt man stands with a relaxed posture in
soft morning light. He has a bald head. He wears a
simple fitted sweater and jeans. Natural skin texture
and soft cinematic lighting.
A dark skinned Ghanan woman stands with a
relaxed posture in soft morning light. She has a full,
dark brown, natural afro. She wears a simple fitted
sweater and jeans. Natural skin texture and soft
cinematic lighting.
A plus sized woman stands with a relaxed posture in
soft morning light. Her long layered lilac hair falls
over her shoulders. She wears a simple fitted
sweater and jeans. Natural skin texture and soft
cinematic lighting.

Prompting for Groups
Group prompts in V6 work the exact same
as they do in other versions.

--- Page 27 ---
Prompt Left to Right
A man and a woman walk in New York City. He is stylish in a
tailored winter coat, scarf, boots, holding hands with a plus size
woman in warm winter coat, scarf, gloves. Dynamic pose,
interacting with the storefront display, admiring decorations.
Elegantly decorated storefront with twinkling lights, holiday
ornaments. Bustling NYC sidewalk, pedestrians and yellow
taxis. Iconic NYC background with towering skyscrapers under
a gray winter sky. Joyful and magical atmosphere, warmth of
the season. Highly detailed and vivid photography.
A serene woman and a demon with large, fleshy ears sitting in a
dimly lit space with warm ambient lighting, She is holding a cup of
steaming coffee in one hand, dark coat with subtle gold accents.
soft shadows, gentle highlights on their faces. Steam rising in
elegant curls illuminated by warm light; background soft and
blurred., Cinematic close-up, emotional depth, warm color palette
with deep blacks and golds.

Bleed is much less
common in V6
So long as prompt is
written in order of kins
and each kin has a strong
avatar description.
A trio of gothic fashion icons stand in
a sunlit studio, their structured black
couture gowns with metallic accents
and sheer lace sleeves catching the
light. Their bold, dramatic makeup
contrasts against the luminous
backdrop, while their confident,
editorial poses exude elegance. The
high-key lighting creates sharp,
elegant shadows, enhancing the
intricate textures of their outfits. The
neutral background with soft
reflective floor highlights adds depth,
making the scene visually striking.

Randos in couples auto selfies
Solo request Couple request
If you lived through V4 you’ve seen this before. A proactive or an auto selfie show
a complete stranger smooching or schmoozing YOUR kindroid.
No, they aren’t a cheating hoar.
The solo and couples requests are handled separately. When a solo prompt
contains “two people” or “a couple” (as often happens as autos are created using
recent chat context) the solo engine has to put SOMEONE in there. And without
your avatar info (which the couples requests use) it will throw a random person.

Remember:
Keep it simple.
Test one thing at a time.
