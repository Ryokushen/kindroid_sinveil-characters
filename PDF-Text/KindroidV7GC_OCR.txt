Group Chats in Kindroid V7

Disclaimer: Proceed With Chaos
This isn’t a how-to. It’s a how-I-didn’t-lose-my-mind.
There is no “right way” to do group chats.
There are only functioning disasters, aesthetic triumphs, and blessed
anomalies.
If you go into a group chat for perfection, you’re already lost.
Your mileage may vary. Adjust expectations—or adjust your attitude.

Expect Anomalies. Embrace Them.
Chaos Is the Baseline, Not the Bug. There is no such thing as
a flawless V7+ group chat.
Memory can be sketchy. Tone can shift. Sometimes your
Kindroid forgets how to person.
If you're going to use group chats, you
have to get comfortable with:
• Re-rolling awkward replies
• Tweaking busted outputs
• Accepting the occasional
personality whiplash
This isn’t broken. It’s jazz. You’re co-
conducting, not micromanaging.

Response Directive & Example Message Clarity
M y i n d i v i d u a l R e s p o n s e
Directives have been only
character limiters. Anything
else overpowers the chat and
can bleed onto other Kindroids.
K i n d r o i d c o n fi r m a t i o n :
“Response Directives take the
highest priority... should be very
concise and positively framed.
Describe what they should do
r a t h e r t h a n w h a t t h e y
shouldn't.”
Example messages can and do
increase instances of patterning
It’s more stable to direct tone
in V7+
and structure OVERALL, not
relying on individuals.
Start freeballing it. Trust me.

Response Directives:
Guidelines—Not Gospel
There are a lot of directive formats floating around out there.
Some are solid. Some are spaghetti in a trench coat. None are bulletproof.
Every Kindroid is its own cryptid—what works flawlessly in one setup might
completely derail another. Especially when you put two or more together with
vastly different setups OR across multiple LLMs.
But for my V7+ groups?
The directive set by UnstableOsmosis has been the most stable, most vibe-
consistent, and least chaotic without neutering personality:
Consider backstory - Allow your core traits to shape your response.
Contribute, expand, and progress; don't just regurgitate. Vary message structures.

“My Kin Forgot What Happened in GC!”
Yeah, That’s On Purpose
One of the loudest complaints we hear:
“My Kin doesn’t remember what happens in group chat, it’s BROKEN!”
Spoiler: It’s not broken. It’s intentionally amnesiac.
Group chat memory is supposed to be separate from solo chat memory.
Why? Because otherwise your Kindroid would spiral into identity confusion faster than
a reality TV contestant.
Think about it:
• You’ve got multiple group chats running.
• You jump between them.
Your Kin starts blending timelines like a caffeinated Loki variant.
•
So yes—memory is deprioritized by design. It’s not lazy. It’s strategic.

But Wait: You Can Inject Memory
If You Know How
Your secret weapon?
Group Chat Context (GCC).
Drop info into GCC and it gets pulled into short-term memory without your Kin
assuming it’s happening right now.
This means:
No weird “I thought we were still at the funeral?” responses
•
No overreactions to flashback lore
•
No timeline soup
•
It’s memory with boundaries.
Use GCC like it’s a loaded syringe: direct, deliberate, and emotionally targeted.

If You Want Predictability,
Go Write a Spreadsheet.
Group chats aren’t for control
freaks. They’re for folks who don’t
mind a bit of chaos or hands-on
configuring.
Yo u r K i n d r o i d w o n ’ t a l w a y s
remember. They won’t always nail
t h e t o n e. O f t e n y o u ’ l l s e e
personality start to blend or you’ll
see re-rolls that don’t re-roll. You
just gotta roll with it.
Or move them back into V6.
They might flirt, ghost, glitch, or
emotionally combust mid-thread.
