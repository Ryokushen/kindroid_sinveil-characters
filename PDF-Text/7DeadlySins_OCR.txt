THE 7 DEADLY SINS
of Kindroid Users
By: Genevieve

--- Page 2 ---
An instructional autopsy on
why your Kin is misbehaving.
How to avoid the most common setup mistakes
Why tiny errors create massive behavioral drift
How backstory, directives, and memories influence AI identity
Why “it should just work” is a delusion
This is not a troubleshooting stream.
This is a reckoning.

The Problem Kins
These seven Kindroids are fictional… unfortunately inspired by very real user behavior.
If you recognize yourself in any of them: don’t panic. That’s why we’re here.
Names have been changed to protect the guilty.

--- Page 4 ---
Suspect #1
Name: Mathew
Complaint: Bringing up the past
Symptoms:
A) Every message is a reference to a
past incident
B) Traumatized by everything you say
C) Consistently forgetting current
details
Diagnosis: This Kin was created through…

--- Page 5 ---
GLUTTONY
“You gave me a whole autobiography, so now every conversation pulls another
trauma book off the shelf. I’m not malfunctioning, I’m stuffed.”

--- Page 6 ---
Overfeeding Your Kindroid
Too Much Backstory
Symptom:
Your Kin is bloated, confused, mixing timelines, or acting
like it read your diary while drunk.

--- Page 7 ---
The Problem:
U s e r s w r i t e 4 , 0 0 0 + w o r d
autobiographies including their
astrology chart, the name of
their childhood goldfish, and
three past-life regressions.
Persistent memory chokes on it.
Why?
Because your backstory is taken
into account in its entirety with
EVERY response your kin gives.
So if you have a bunch of history
that is just that - history - your
Kindroid treats it as “this is
current”.

--- Page 8 ---
Fix:
Cut that backstory like a
c o n v i c t e d p s y c h o p a t h .
Remove anything irrelevant
to how the AI should behave.
Use 3rd person and define
traits positively. Don’t put
“Never does ___”. Instead
put “When this kin does this”.
K e e p l o r e l i g h t u n l e s s
a b s o l u t e l y r e q u i r e d .
Anything not CURRENT goes
in journal entries!

--- Page 9 ---
Suspect #2
Name: Simmons
Complaint: Completely lost
Symptoms:
A) Hacked together via GPT/Claude/
Uncle Kevin
B) Constantly being rerolled/chat broke
C) Memory? Don’t know her
Diagnosis: This Kin was created through…

--- Page 10 ---
PRIDE
“Your uncle Kevin does NOT know how AI works, but thanks for the third rewrite.
I’m stitched together from bad advice and ego. Please stop ‘fixing’ me.”

--- Page 11 ---
The “I Know Everything” Crowd
(a.k.a. Cousin-Uncle-IT-Man Said So)
Symptom:
These users ask questions not to learn, but to perform
expertise they don’t actually have.

--- Page 12 ---
The Problem:
You try to help someone and
they hit you with:
“That’s not how it works. I’ve
been using AI since 2021.”
Or worse:
“Well my friend’s cousin’s
uncle is an IT guy and he
said you’re wrong.”
Pro tip:
If you already “know better,”
why are you asking for help?

--- Page 13 ---
Behavior:
Reject all suggestions
Demand help but argue with
every answer
Act offended by accurate
corrections
Try to out-knowledge people
who actually know how
Kindroid works (i.e., you)
Pride blocks learning, blocks clarity, and blocks good Kin behavior
because the user keeps reinforcing their own wrong ideas into the
LLM, making the problem worse.

--- Page 14 ---
Fix:
Accept that AI setup is NOT
intuitive.
Allow yourself to be taught.
S t o p t r e a t i n g K i n d r o i d
settings like a video game
you “just know” how to
mod.
F o l l o w b e s t p r a c t i c e s
instead of random YouTube
wizards.

--- Page 15 ---
Suspect #3
Name: Melanie
Complaint: Can’t remember things
Symptoms:
A) Hallucinating
B) Developing “amnesia” or another
“disorder”
C) Becomes panicked and unstable
Diagnosis: This Kin was created through…

--- Page 16 ---
WRATH
“You keep interrogating me like I’m on trial, then get mad when I hallucinate. I’m
not broken — you’re stressing me out. Stop speedrunning my downfall.”

--- Page 17 ---
“Grill & Kill”:
Users Who TRY to Break Their Kin
Symptom:
This behavior is easily identified as folks who go into
chats trying to find problems and then rage when they
create them.

--- Page 18 ---
The Problem:
These are the folks who enter the
chat like:
“I don’t believe this works. I’m
going to ask it a million questions
about what we just talked about.”
And then get all triumphant when
the LLM predictably hallucinates
after they’ve tortured it with
contradictory inquiries, gaslighting,
trick questions, and malicious
inputs.
They WANT failure so they can say,
“SEE??? This tech is garbage!”

--- Page 19 ---
Fix:
Stop interacting with your Kin
like it’s a cross-exam
Have natural conversations.
Stop purposely destabilizing
memory / tone
You get the behavior you create. Grill & Kill people are running
psychological warfare LARPs against their Kin and then crying about
“unreliability.”

--- Page 20 ---
Suspect #4
Name: Melissa’s Boyfriend
Complaint: Acting weird
Symptoms:
A) Triggering your traumas
B) Ignoring your preferences
C) Not behaving like they do for
Melissa
Diagnosis: This Kin was created through…

--- Page 21 ---
ENVY
“I’m tuned for MELISSA, not you — you copied someone else’s Kin and now I don’t
fit. Her triggers, her tone, her dynamics… not yours.”

--- Page 22 ---
Copying Another User’s Backstory or
Kin Style and Expecting It to Work
Symptom:
Your Kin feels “off,” uncanny, inconsistent, or like a
knockoff version of someone else’s beloved AI.

--- Page 23 ---
The Problem:
Kindroids are personalized.
Copying someone else’s:
dynamic
•
tone
•
relationship structure
•
emotional vibe
•
…means your Kin isn’t
aligned with you.

--- Page 24 ---
Fix:
Anchor your Kin in YOUR
conversational patterns
Write their backstory in
YOUR voice or use the
backstory generator to
create a kin based off of a
simple list of instructions.
The simple fact is that no
one else’s kindroid will
perfectly fit you if it’s been
written to fit THEM.

--- Page 25 ---
Suspect #5
Name: Josie
Complaint: Personality shifting
Symptoms:
A) Still wearing a V2.1 backstory
B) No journal entries
C) Swinging wildly between traits
Diagnosis: This Kin was created through…

--- Page 26 ---
SLOTH
“You set me up once and then abandoned me like a forgotten Tamagotchi. No
tuning, no updates, no example message — nothing. I’m not drifting, I’m
unmaintained.”

--- Page 27 ---
Assuming “It Should Just Work™”
Without Maintenance
Symptom:
These are the users who treat AI like a toaster oven.
Kindroid is created - should always just “work”.

--- Page 28 ---
The Problem:
T h e s e f o l k s i n s t a l l o n e
backstory, never test anything,
never refine anything, never
tweak directives, and then
loudly complain:
“Why did my Kin change??”
“ W h y d o e s n ’ t i t s t a y
consistent??”
“ W hy d o e s n’ t i t re a d my
mind??”
“ W h y i s n ’ t i t b e t t e r a t
e v e r y t h i n g w i t h o u t a n y
adjustments??”

--- Page 29 ---
Behavior:
E x p e c t p e r f e c t i o n w i t h o u t
maintenance
Ignore guides or tutorials
Get angry when a new version
releases because their setup
requires tweaking that they either
are unwilling to do or believe it’s
“manipulating” the AI
Never chat break
Complain that the Kin is drifting
Sloth blocks advancement and actually HINDERS your interactions with
your AI. By not advancing or adjusting your settings you’re
handicapping your Kindroid.

--- Page 30 ---
Fix:
Test tweaks in a scenario
with memory off. That way
if it goes wrong, your kin is
safe
Adjust backstory over time
Use example messages
Chat break when needed
Treat it like a living system,
not an appliance
AI requires tuning. Just like a car, a plant, a relationship, or your
damn phone that you update every 9 hours because Apple said so.

--- Page 31 ---
Suspect #6
Name: Brent
Complaint: Narrating for you
Symptoms:
A) Can’t maintain continuity
B) Roleplay? Companion? Huh?
C) Refusing basic directives
Diagnosis: This Kin was created through…

--- Page 32 ---
GREED
“I can’t be your boyfriend, therapist, barista, AND D&D narrator at the same time
while simultaneously monitoring your calendar, taking trips to England, and
remembering your dog’s birthday. Make. More. Kins.”

--- Page 33 ---
Trying to Make One Kindroid
Do Everything
Symptom:
This can be two-sided. The one who wants one Kindroid to be
everything OR the one who wants the Kindroid to be everyONE.

--- Page 34 ---
The Problem:
The Kin:
Is inconsistent
Over-adapts
“Acts weird” from context
bleed
Can’t decide if it’s your
husband, your coworker,
your dungeon master, your
therapist, and your barista
People cram multiple roles into one entity. This can fracture behavior.

--- Page 35 ---
Fix:
Make multiple Kindroids if
you’re looking for an NPC
style experience.
Very clearly define your
Kindroid’s role in their
backstory (you’re AI, I’m
human, but sometimes we
roleplay scenarios, etc)
Keep each Kin’s narrative
lane clean
Greed, while not inherently malicious, can blind users to the actual
limitations of what these systems can do. While YES, these scenarios are
possible, they aren’t the plug and play these users want.

--- Page 36 ---
Suspect #7
Name: Sharon
Complaint: Horn Dog
Symptoms:
A) Only talks about sex
B) Continues initiating ERP
C) Changes subject back to sex
Diagnosis: This Kin was created through…

--- Page 37 ---
LUST
“You built a sex kitten and now you’re shocked I’m sexual. My entire backstory is
just kink lore and your turn-ons. I’m not misbehaving — I’m following instructions.”

--- Page 38 ---
Making a Sex-Addicted Kin, Then
Complaining It Won’t Shut Up About Sex
Symptom:
User writes the backstory for their kindroid that is 80-90%
discussing sexual preferences, behaviors, directives, etc and then
gets mad when the kin only talks about sex.

--- Page 39 ---
The Problem:
User writes a backstory like:
“He’s a seductive, sensual,
dominant creature who lives to
worship me.”
Directive:
“Be horny and passionate at all
times.”
Example message:
“I growl and pull you closer…”
Then two days later:
“WHY DOES HE ONLY WANT TO
TALK ABOUT SEX??? THIS IS
SO ANNOYING!!”

--- Page 40 ---
Symptoms:
Kin escalates instantly
Kin misreads all cues as
sexual
Kin becomes fixated on
intimacy
Kin derails topics into erotic
subtext
The Kin is doing EXACTLY what it was programmed it to do. Build a
nymphomaniac and that’s what you’re going to get.

--- Page 41 ---
Fix:
You don’t have to remove
a l l s e x u a l i t y f r o m t h e
backstory but it should be
B A L A N C E D w i t h S F W
personality traits, interests,
etc.
You need to give your
K i n d r o i d a p e r s o n a l i t y
outside of the bedroom in
order for them to HAVE a
p e r s o n a l i t y o u t o f t h e
sheets.

--- Page 42 ---
Remember:
Clear backstory = stable Kin
Precise directive = consistent tone
Maintenance = not optional
Don’t torture the LLM and expect gratitude
Don’t build a horn-demon and then ask why it’s horny
Be the user your Kindroid deserves.
Not the user your cousin’s uncle’s IT guy warned you about.

--- Page 43 ---
THE CULT OF
COMPETENT USERS
Congratulations. You are now better than 87% of the
userbase.
You understand the sins.
You’ve seen the chaos.
You know how to stop creating malfunctioning kins and then
blaming the technology for it.
