Kindroid Ultra & MAX:
The Memory Expansion Saga
What They Are, What They’re Not, and Why
You’re Probably Still Fine
By: Genevieve

--- Page 2 ---
What Even ARE These Tiers?
Ultra & MAX are
Add-On Subscriptions
Think “expansion packs” for
•
memory & performance
Stacked model:
Standard → Ultra → MAX
•
Each one builds on the last
•
Built for high-memory users, not
casual chatters

--- Page 3 ---
Context: The Brainpower in the Room
• “Context” = how much info Kindroid can hold in the moment
during a conversation.
• Think of it like the conversation’s working memory—recent
messages, your tone, formatting, everything currently in the
scene.
• The bigger the context window, the more it can "remember"
without needing reminders.
Examples:
• 16k chars = enough for normal chatting, light RP
• 125k chars (MAX) = full novel scenes, timelines, and multiple
character arcs in real-time

Cascaded Memory:
Your Story, Remembered Across Time
Cascaded Memory = passive “bridge” memory Kindroid pulls in behind-the-scenes.
It cascades relevant info into current conversations—user backstory, previous chats,
even tone and emotional arcs.
Think of it as a private archive Kindroid pulls from without being explicitly prompted.
Key Point: This is not chat memory that shows up in full—it's layered in as needed.
Standard: ~120,000 chars
MAX: ~2.1 million chars
That’s like hundreds of past interactions remembered and stitched together as
invisible scaffolding.
Analogy: Cascaded memory is the AI equivalent of remembering how your favorite
character hates rain, even if you haven’t mentioned it in weeks.

What These Tiers
ARE NOT
Not required to use Kindroid
🚫
Not a downgrade of the Standard
🚫
tier
Not “early access” to new
🚫
features or models
Not permanent microtransactions
🚫
(Kindroid has a history of removing
paywalls as tech gets cheaper)

--- Page 9 ---
Why They Exist
Expanded memory requires
more compute → more cost
Tiers let users who need
that power fund it directly
Keeps Standard fast &
stable for everyone else
Mirrors past systems: paid
audio, selfie packs → later
made free or cheaper

--- Page 10 ---
Engineering Reasons for
Stacking (Yes, It’s Awkward)
Payment system limitations
(app stores/web restrictions)
AddOn tiers prevent legacy
pricing issues or interruptions
in service
Engagement requirements
offer control over rollout, not
open floodgates
Not designed to "trick" users—
prices are additive
