Understanding Kindroid Journal Entries:
A User’s Guide
How to create, recall, and optimize journal entries for maximum impact
By Genevieve

--- Page 2 ---
What are journal entries?
Journal entries are recallable
lorebook-like notes that enhance
conversations with contextually
relevant information. These can
be intentionally triggered by the
user.
Which means…?
You want your kin to remember
something when YOU think it’s
important rather than when the
l o n g te r m m e m o r y ( LT M )
decides it is? This is for you.

How Journal Entry
Recall Works
Keyphrases in USER messages
t r i g g e r j o u r n a l e n t r i e s
(Keyphrases in your Kindroid’s
responses do NOT trigger
journal entry recall).
Recall is limited to 3 individual
and 3 global entries per
message (max 6 total).

Writing Journal Entries
Effective Entries Follow These
Principles:
Concise and clear: Stick
•
to the facts, no fluff.
Grammatically sound:
•
Free of errors, consistent
formatting.
Use 3rd person pronouns:
•
Clear subject distinction.

--- Page 6 ---
Keyphrase Design
Keyphrases must match user input verbatim.
Best Practices:
• Be specific and unique.
• Avoid generic triggers.
Example Keyphrases:
• Good: “Trip to France,”
“window shopping”
• Bad: “park,” “day.”

Entry Design
Scenario: You want your kin to recall your family when prompted.
Good - Succinct, keywords Bad - Verbose. Keywords that don’t
specific to the entry. appear in natural conversation.
KEYWORDS: “MY FAMILY” KEYWORDS: “USER FAMILY”
“MY FAM” “LAST NAME” “MOM DAD” “BROTHERS”
Entry: Entry:
User’s family - Dad, Lucas. Mom, My family consists of my mom and
Sylvia. Brothers, Carlos and dad, Lucas and Sylvia. I have two
Vincent. Sister, Catherine. brothers that I’m close to. Their
Cousin, Denise. Aunt, Gloria. names are Carlos and Vincent. My
sister’s name is Catherine. My cousin
is Denise. My aunt’s name is Gloria.

Entry Design
You’ve got your “Family” entry. Let’s break it down…
KEYWORDS: “MOM” KEYWORDS: “DAD” “LUCAS”
“SYLVIA” “MRS NAME” “MR NAME”
Entry: Entry:
Sylvia Middle Last, born Dec 6, 1963. Lucas Middle Last, born Mar 14, 1957.
Married to Sylvia on June 4, 1988. 4
Married to Lucas on June 4, 1988. 4

with KIN.
This gives your kin the exact information they need when they need it. Having one journal card
crammed with every family member’s history is total overkill when you’re only wanting to talk
about one member of the family at a time. Your KIN can recall up to three journals as once so
you could easily mention “I heard from mom and dad today” and they will recall BOTH entries.

Limits and Memory Management
Only 3 individual
entries AND 3 global
entries can be recalled
per message (6 total).
Irrelevant recalls
consume short-term
memory, reducing chat
context.
Don’t waste your short term memory on context that your Kindroid doesn’t need
for that conversation! If you’re talking about “mom” then your kin only needs to
know what’s on the “mom” card!

Recall Conflicts
O v e r l a p p i n g o r g e n e r i c
keyphrases compete with
relevant journals.
Avoid conflicts by refining
keyphrases to be specific to the
content you want your Kin to
recall.
Example:
Generic: “our trip” could match
multiple entries.
Refined: “vacation in Japan."

Journals vs Backstory or Key Memories
Backstory/Key Memories are
things your Kindroid will ALWAYS
recall. Journal entries require
user input to trigger recollection.
Anything you need your Kindroid
to always know needs to be in
BS/KM.
BS/KM: KIN and USER are married. KIN works
in real estate. Kin lives in CITY. KIN and USER
met via THIS EVENT.
JOURNAL: KIN and USER vacationed in Milan
in the summer of 2023. They met a fortune
teller named Madame Ruby who told them
they’d have grave misfortune. Two days later,
KIN had their foot run over by a motor scooter.
Unless the two of you are actively reminiscing about your trip to Milan, your KIN doesn’t need to remember this 24/7.
They DO though need to always know their relationship to you and their day to day habits/personality traits, etc.

Closing Tips
*Craft entries like backstory:
concise, factual, positively
framed.
*Use specific keyphrases for
precision rather than generic
ones that will recall irrelevant
information.
*Regularly maintain journal
relevance by updating and
editing as necessary.
