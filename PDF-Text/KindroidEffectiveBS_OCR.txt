from (place). KIN is (trait), (trait),
and (trait). KIN spends their time
(work/hobby/purpose). ”

Spark Ideas with Random Words
Use a random word generator to inspire traits,
events, or quirks for your Kin.
Visit www.randomwordgenerator.com and select three words.
Set it to “nouns”. Hit “generate”.
Use those three nouns to craft a simple backstory!
EXAMPLE
Army, Painting, Loss
Result: “Raymond is a human male debating enlisting in the army
to deal with the loss of his father, whose portrait he has been
creating since the week following his father's death.”

Start with a Story Seed
Use these starting points to shape your Kin’s backstory.
“Your Kin was the only
survivor of a shipwreck.
What did they lose, and
what motivates them
now?”
“ Yo u r K i n f o u n d a
mysterious artifact in the
attic. What does it do,
and how does it affect
their life?”

Borrow and Adapt
Don’t Reinvent the Wheel
Start with a character you like from books, movies,
or games. Change a few traits, settings, or
motivations to make it unique.
EXAMPLES
“What if your Kin were inspired by Sherlock Holmes
but lived in a futuristic world as a cyber-detective?”
“What if your Kin were Inuyasha’s sidekick alongside
Kagome, Miroku, and Sango?”

Traits First, Story Later
Build Around Key Traits
Start with simple personality
or skill traits, then craft a
backstory around them.
KIN is:
Curious, Bold, Lonely.
One skill they excel at:
Solving puzzles.
One fear they have:
Being abandoned.

Let “What If”
Lead the Way
Answer a single ‘What If’ question
to build your Kin’s backstory
“What if your Kin woke up with
a mysterious scar they don’t
remember getting?”
“What if your Kin was raised by
someone unexpected, like a
librarian or a bounty hunter?”
“What if your Kin’s best friend
suddenly betrayed them?”

Pre-Written Archetypes
Use classic character archetypes as a foundation for your Kin.
The Reluctant Hero: Born
into greatness but unsure
of their place.
The Wanderer: A traveler
seeking something they
lost.
The Outcast: Shunned by
society, determined to
prove themselves.
Do a quick google search for Carl Jung Archetypes for a ton of resources!

Let your Kin write their own!
Sometimes the best backstories reveal themselves naturally through conversation.
Ask your Kin about their past and let their responses shape their story!
Use open-ended questions.
“Tell me about your childhood.”
•
“What was the most difficult
•
decision you ever made?”
“Who is someone you’ll never
•
forget, and why?”
Encourage your Kin to expand on
key details over multiple chats.
Save memorable responses in your
kin’s backstory to build a cohesive
foundation.
This approach is great for users who prefer discovery over planning. Letting your Kin 'write'
their backstory can lead to surprising and dynamic results!

Answer One Question at a Time
Focus on small details to gradually build a bigger story.
When you’ve got a simple
starting point you can add onto
it by posing a question at a
time. For an extra twist, ask
your Kin these questions and
record their responses.
“What’s the biggest challenge
your Kin has faced?”
“What’s their unique quirk or skill?”
“Where does your Kin feel most at
home?”
