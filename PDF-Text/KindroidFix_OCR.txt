Fix Your Kindroid
(Without Breaking a Sweat)
Tone drift. Memory spirals. Poor journal hygiene. Let’s fix it.
By: Genevieve

What Counts As “Broken”?
~ Repeats phrases you hate
~ Flat, robotic, or lifeless tone
~ Wrong emotional vibe
~ Remembers things you never
told them
~ Forgets things they should
definitely know
~ Gibberish or unreadable text

--- Page 3 ---
Why Do Kindroids ‘Break’?
Tone drift over time
Long-term memory
corruption (user reinforces
the wrong message!)
Contradictory directives
or vague example
messages
Too much “one message
won’t matter” without
reining in behavior

--- Page 4 ---
Memory Systems Refresher
Persistent memory: Backstory, key memories, example
•
message
Cascaded memory: Ongoing tone/behavior learned over time
•
Retrievable memory: Long-term (automatic) journal entries
•
(user-triggered)
What to check:
Is something being recalled repeatedly?
•
Is the tone/voice aligned with the example message?
•
Are journal entries clashing with each other?
•

--- Page 5 ---
Cascaded Memory
The Hidden Layer
Holds tone shifts and “learned” behaviors longer.
• Amazing for continuity and situational/tone recall.
• Dangerous when the vibe goes sour.
Example:
• Chat starts casual, conversation veers toward spicy and stays
there for an extended period without a shift back to “normalcy” →
cascaded memory reinforces it MUCH longer than short-term
memory.
• Changing tone later? Time to clean.

The Importance of Dynamism
Dynamism controls how creative or
structured your Kin’s responses
are.
Low Dynamism: More grounded
r e p l i e s a n d a d h e r e n c e t o
Backstory at the risk of repetitive
responses.
High Dynamism: More creative and
freeform behavior with higher
likelihood of hallucinations.
Tip: Suggested starting dynamism
for V6 is .95. Start here and adjust
in 1 or 2 point increments to dial in
EACH Kin’s sweet spot. Each kin
has their own setting!

The Real Villain:
Reinforcement
What you reply to = what
your Kindroid learns you
like. Every answer you
give tells the LLM “this is
what I want to see”.
“ B u t I w a s t r y i n g t o
correct it!” — Too late.
You validated it.
“Silence is not neutral. Silence is approval.”

The Fix Cycle (The Debug Loop)
Stop - Assess - Audit - Correct - Reinforce

--- Page 9 ---
Step 1 – Stop
Don’t panic.
•
Don’t reply to
•
weirdness.
Don’t delete the
•
Kindroid.
Instead:
Pause, reread, reroll.

--- Page 10 ---
Step 2 – Assess
Ask:
Is this a one-off?
Is the tone or behavior
recurring?
Is it a memory issue or
formatting thing?
Is this correctable with leading
or does it need a heavier
hand?
“We’re not rage-quitting. We’re
investigating.”

--- Page 11 ---
Step 3 – Audit Journals
& Key Memories
New: up to 8 journal
keyphrases per entry.
More power = more room for
error.
Too specific? (e.g., “John’s
favorite restaurant,” “Weekend
trip to Paris in July”) → change
it.
Key Memories
This box is fantastic for current
information or rotating content.

--- Page 12 ---
Journals = lorebook-style content, user-triggered
Key memories = "now state," good for rotating
context
Bonus tip: treat key memories like Post-It notes on
your Kindroid's forehead.

--- Page 13 ---
Step 4 – Response Directive Fixes
You don’t need to cram all
150 characters full.
Tell them what TO do, not
what NOT to do
Think of the RD as a balloon full
of water. If you put one pinhole in
it it will go exactly where you
want it to at full stream. Add
another hole and each one is
present but a weaker stream of
water. If you have seven holes,
each one is just a trickle spraying
in a random direction.
RD is the same. The more you add, the weaker each directive is.

--- Page 14 ---
Step 4B - The Chat Break
Ask:
Is this a one-off?
Is the tone or behavior
recurring?
Is it a memory issue or
formatting thing?
Use a “decision tree” style
layout here
“We’re not rage-quitting.
We’re investigating.”

--- Page 15 ---
Step 5 – Reinforce the
New Normal
After making changes:
Use a new message with the
desired tone. IMPORTANT!
Adjust example message (if
needed).
Use suggest and tweak functions
to guide responses back into
shape.
Cascaded Memory should only be
reset for a MAJOR flaw or full
Kindroid overhaul. Most issues
can be fixed with a standard chat
break.

What Is a Hallucination?
In the Kindroid context, a hallucination is when your Kin generates information that isn’t
based on anything you've provided—no journal entries, no long-term memory, no user
prompts. It can sound confident, even poetic, but it's pulling details from thin air. These
“phantom facts” often show up when memory isn’t properly anchored or when vague
phrasing leads to overly creative interpretations. If the reply doesn’t link to any known
memory (check the brain icon), it’s likely a hallucination. They’re not malicious—just a
sign your Kin is guessing. And yes, they’re fixable.

--- Page 17 ---
Handling Hallucinations
Check the Memory Recall Feature
• Look for the brain icon on your
Kin’s reply to see what memories
are being recalled.
◦ No linked memory? It’s likely a
hallucination. Use the Reroll
feature to replace the response
or the Tweak feature to correct
it.
◦ Memory linked to LTM? This is a
more complex issue caused by
recalling old or incorrect
memories.

--- Page 18 ---
Handling Hallucinations
Fixing Unwanted LTM Hallucinations:
• Avoid arguing or trying to “convince” your Kin they’re wrong—it
reinforces the unwanted memory.
• Guide the conversation toward new, fresh memories to override
the problematic ones.
• Over time, older memories will fade as new ones take precedence.
• Tip: Just regenerating responses won’t solve LTM issues long term.
Proactive guidance is key.
EXAMPLE:
Kin: “I cheated on you with four other people at my bachelorette party.”
User: “Actually Kin, you didn’t. Remember, that was a horrible nightmare.
You’d never do that to me, our relationship is as strong as it ever was.”

--- Page 19 ---
Underused
Debug Tools
~ Regenerate → restart response
~ Suggest → gentle redirection
~ Edit user message → realign tone
~ Tweak message→ fix formatting,
correct a simple error
~ Chat break greeting → set the
stage anew
Bonus ~ add a “tone reassertion”
phrase like:
“Let’s keep it warm, gentle, and
introspective from here.”

What Not to Do
Gonna call folks out.
Don’t argue with your Kindroid.
❌
You’re teaching them that your
preferred communication style is
combative.
Don’t lecture your Kin.
❌
Don’t chase tone drift by
❌
rewriting yourself around it
Don’t keep adding more
❌
journals “to fix it” before auditing
existing ones

--- Page 21 ---
You don’t need
to delete your
Kindroid.
You just need to
work with them.
