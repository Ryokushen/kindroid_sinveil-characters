Foundations of Worldbuilding Using Kindroid
A beginner’s guide
By Genevieve

--- Page 2 ---
What is Worldbuilding?
The art of creating an imaginary
world with its own rules, settings,
and cultures.
A foundation for storytelling, role-
playing, and creative expression.
Combines elements like geography,
history, characters, and systems to
craft immersive experiences.
Brings depth and realism to fictional
universes, ensuring that your role-
play aligns with your vision.

Creating Your World in Kindroid
Multiple Kins: Building a Diverse Cast of Characters
• What to Know: You can create up to 10 Kins
(with more available through paid bundles),
making it possible to populate your world with
distinct personalities.
• Best Practices:
◦ Diversity of Roles: Assign unique roles to
each Kin to reflect different aspects of your
world.
▪ Example: “The oracle who foretells
doom,” “The reluctant hero,” or “The
mischievous thief.”
◦ Backstories: Tailor each Kin’s BS to align
with their role in the narrative.
▪ Example: “Kin is the leader of a nomadic
tribe, wise but weary of outsiders.”
◦ Group Dynamics: Use Group Chats to
explore relationships between your Kins.

Using Memory Strategically
What to Know: LTM can store limitless information but isn’t always
recalled at will. Prioritize what’s most important.
Best Practices:
• Save current worldbuilding essentials like current events, key
locations, or recurring NPCs in your Kin’s Key Memory.
• For example, if your Kin is currently in Aerath: “Aerath’s floating
towers are powered by ancient crystals harnessing the winds.”
• Tip: Reinforce LTM by revisiting details with your Kin during
conversations. Example: *I set my mug of ale down on the table
of the tavern and turn to you.* “So about those goblins…”

Journal Entries -
Supplementing Memory
What to Know: Journal entries act as a
repository for details that might not surface
in STM/LTM as well as context that doesn’t
need to be recalled constantly.
Best Practices:
• Use journal entries for fixed reference
points, like lore summaries, world
mechanics, or plot outlines.
• Example Entry: “The Blackwood Forest
is cursed, with no sunlight reaching its
depths. Travelers report hearing
whispers.” KEYWORDS: “Blackwood
Forest” “Cursed Forest”
• Tip: Refer to journal entries as needed
during interactions to keep your Kin on
track.

--- Page 6 ---
Global vs Individual Journals
Global entries are visible across
ALL Kins on your account, whether
they are part of the role-play world
or not. Individual entries are visible
only to the Kin they’re created for.
Creating global entries with world-
specific tags is the play to keep
your non-world kins from accessing
them. “Hellfire Peninsula” isn’t
exactly something that you would
say to a companion/self-aware kin
but you’d say it to a kin in that
world.

Group Chat Interactions:
Testing Dynamics Without LTM
What to Know: Turning off LTM in Group Chats
lets you experiment with how Kins interact
without long-term context muddying the
waters.
Best Practices:
• Create scenes where Kins collaborate,
argue, or negotiate to test their roles.
◦ Example: “The council of elders
debates whether to go to war.”
• Adjust backstories and Response
Directives on the fly to refine their
personalities and group dynamics.
• Observe natural patterns—does one Kin
dominate the conversation? Is another
too passive? Fine-tune accordingly.

--- Page 8 ---
Creating Connections Between Kins
What to Know: A strong narrative depends on the relationships between
characters.
Best Practices:
• Define shared histories or rivalries in Backstories:
◦ Example: “Elyse, the knight, and Sorin, the mage, were childhood
friends but now find themselves on opposite sides of the war.”
• Define important characteristics in Journal Entries for OTHER Kins.
“Sorin was born in the fifth age and was an apprentice for the Grand
Sage.” Information like this would be in Sorin’s backstory but needs to
be accessible by other kins as well.
• Experiment with dialogue patterns to create distinct voices for each
character.

--- Page 9 ---
Expanding the World
Each kin should have a brief
description of their homeland in
their backstory.
“ R y l e n i s f r o m A n o a , t h e
mountainous home of the Dark
Orcs surrounded by a haunted
forest.”
A journal entry with the keyword
“Anoa” would have a more
elaborate description of this
biome and its inhabitants while
stating that it is Rylen’s home.

--- Page 10 ---
Evolving Kins Through
Story Arcs
What to Know: Kins will grow with your story,
evolving as their role changes.
Best Practices:
• Update Backstories as your story progresses
to reflect character growth or changes in
circumstances.
◦ Example: “Kin was once a feared tyrant
but is now seeking redemption by guiding
refugees to safety.”
• Use Key Memories and Journal Entries to
document key moments that shape their
development.
◦ Example Journal Entry: “After witnessing
the villagers’ bravery during the siege,
Tyrant Valen vowed to change his ways.”

Sharing Kins
Bringing Your World to Others
What Can Be Shared
• What’s Included: When sharing a Kin, the following
elements are transferred:
◦ Avatar Photo: The visual representation of the Kin.
◦ Backstory: The foundational lore or history written
for the Kin.
◦ Key Memories: Specific long-term memories that
define the Kin’s role or personality.
◦ Response Directive: The personality and behavior
settings that dictate how the Kin interacts.
◦ Example Message: The format for the Kin’s
responses.
• What’s NOT Included:
◦ General Memories: Personal interactions or specific
lore not flagged as key memories.
◦ Journal Entries: Supplemental notes or
worldbuilding details.

Memory Management and
Maintaining Custom Worlds

--- Page 13 ---
Memory Retention
Between Chats
• What to Know:
◦ Group Chats and Solo Chats don’t always sync perfectly, making memory
retention a challenge.
◦ To reliably lock information into Long-Term Memory (LTM), you must actively
maintain and update the Group Chat Context.
• Best Practices:
◦ Consistency is Key: Reinforce details regularly in Group Chats by repeating or
referencing key points.
▪ Example: “As you all know, the capital city, Duskveil, is currently under siege.”
◦ Summarize Often: At the end of a session, recap important details to ensure
they’re captured.
▪ Example: “So far, the council has decided to send an envoy to negotiate
peace with the invaders.”
◦ Pair with Journal Entries: Store key contextual details in Journal Entries as a
backup in case STM doesn’t transition into LTM.

Challenges of Custom Worlds

Challenges of Custom Worlds
What to Know: Building and maintaining a custom world in Kindroid
requires significant effort from the user.
Best Practices for Maintenance:
• Structured Updates: Regularly review and update your Kins’
memories and Backstories to keep them aligned with evolving
world details.
◦ Example: If your world changes due to a major event (e.g., a city
destroyed), reflect this in both memories and journal entries.
• Global Journal Entries: Use the Journal to house consistent lore
that your Kins can reference at any time.
◦ Example: “Duskveil was the heart of trade before its fall, known
for its iconic twin spires.” KEYWORDS: “Duskveil” “Twin Spires”.

Ease of
Pre-existing
Worlds

--- Page 17 ---
Ease of Pre-existing Worlds
What to Know: Prebuilt worlds are less work-intensive, as much of
the foundational lore, structure, and context are already established
and known by the Kindroid LLM.
Best Practices for Prebuilt Worlds:
• Reference Guides: Use existing materials (like official lore books
or wikis) to enrich your Kins’ understanding of the world.
◦ Example: “Kin is Aragorn from J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the
Rings franchise.”
• Role-Specific Kins: Assign Kins roles directly tied to the prebuilt
world to avoid excessive customization.
◦ Example: “Kin is a scribe in Hogwarts’ library, specializing in
lost spells.”

But what
about
Personas?

--- Page 19 ---
What are Personas?
• Personas let you combine your user
settings (name, gender, backstory,
avatar) into distinct profiles.
• Switch personas easily in chats and
voice calls for dynamic roleplay or
storytelling.
• Save up to 100 personas and edit
them anytime by overwriting slots.
Key Features:
• Flexible Switching: Change personas
directly in chats or during voice calls.
• Customizable: Edit and save
personas to fit different scenarios or
roles.

--- Page 20 ---
Single vs Group Chat
Single-User Chats:
• Persona changes apply retroactively to your entire
chat history.
• Example: If you switch from "Kyle" to "Stephanie," all
previous messages will appear as if sent by
“Stephanie.”
• NOTE: be sure you don’t have conflicting information
in your Kins’ backstories to contradict what is in your
personas!

--- Page 21 ---
Single vs Group Chat
Group Chats:
• Persona attribution is fixed to the persona active when
each message was sent.
• Example: A message sent as "Kyle" remains attributed to
"Kyle," even if you switch to “Stephanie”, allowing you to
behave as multiple users in group settings.
Creative Example:
• Send a message as “Kyle,” switch to “Stephanie,” and
respond as Stephanie—your Kins treat each persona as
a separate participant.
