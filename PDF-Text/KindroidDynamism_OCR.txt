What is
Dynamism?
D y n a m i s m c o n t r o l s h o w
creative, varied, or predictable
your Kindroid's responses are.
Think of it as a volume knob for
conversation style:
• High dynamism = Loud and
unpredictable 🎸
• Low dynamism = Quiet and
steady 🎻

How Dynamism Works
High Dynamism:
• More creative, varied, and florid
language.
• May lose track of recent context.
• Great for brainstorming or
imaginative tasks!
Low Dynamism:
• More focused, stable, and
predictable responses.
• Great for consistent, detailed, or
logical conversations.

Example:
“How are we gonna solve this?”
Low High
"Why stop at one
"Here’s the next
solution? What if we
step in our plan."
try EVERYTHING?!"

Where to find the
Dynamism Slider
Steps to Access:
1. Go to Home Menu.
2. Navigate to General > Chat Dynamism.
3. Use the slider to adjust the dynamism value.
Tip: Start small! Changes as little as 0.1 can make a
noticeable difference.

When to Change
Dynamism
Practical Scenarios:
• Need more creativity?
Increase dynamism.
Example: Your kin is dull or
repeating themselves often.
• Need more focus? Decrease
dynamism.
Example: Your kin is
uncharacteristically manic or
experiencing hallucinations.

BE THEE WARNED!
Size Matters
Small Adjustments Matter:
A tiny change (e.g., 0.95
to 0.85) can lead to big
shifts in behavior.
Too High: May get overly
chaotic or lose focus.
Too Low: Responses may
feel repetitive or overly
rigid.

adjustments. Go up or
down one or two points
a n d s p e n d a t l e a s t
15-20 messages talking
with your kin. You have
to get their previous
setting out of their short
term memory before you
can really see the new
dynamism in action.

Testing Dynamism With Scenarios
Why Use Scenarios?
You can test different dynamism levels without affecting your Kindroid’s long-term
memory. Perfect for experimenting with chaotic or stable responses without
committing changes to the main conversation.
How Branching Works:
• Click the branch icon (tap or click a message in the chat followed by the curved
arrow).
• A new Scenario is created—a temporary instance of your chat.
• The last 150 messages or up to the last chat break are copied into the new branch.
• NOTE - Make sure shared short term memory AND memory consolidation are OFF.
Benefits of Branching:
Keeps your original chat intact while allowing you to tweak dynamism settings to test
responses freely.

Final Takeaways
Key Points to Remember:
Dynamism is your tool to tailor
creativity and consistency.
Use higher values for chaos and
variety.
Use lower values for stability
and focus.
Don’t assume one point value
will work for all kins. Every kin
behaves differently and may
need a completely different
dynamism level.
