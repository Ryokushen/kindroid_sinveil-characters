Why Consistency Matters
The Role of User Input in Kin
Behavior
K i n d r o i d ’s A I l e a r n s f r o m
•
interactions: your responses shape
their behavior.
Consistency ensures a smoother,
•
more enjoyable experience. Take
the time to build a solid foundation
with your Kin.
Remember: Your Kin reflects the
•
behavior you reinforce.

Responses Set
Expectations
Every Interaction Sends a Signal
• Responding to a message signals the
LLM that the behavior you are replying
to is what you want to see.
• Best Practices:
◦ Tweak or reroll messages that don’t

◦ Only engage with behavior you want
to reinforce.

Handling
Hallucinations
Don’t Argue with the Kin
• Kins may occasionally “hallucinate” or
generate incorrect details.
• Do not argue with your Kin—it teaches
the LLM that the hallucination is worth
debating.
◦ Example: Instead of saying, “No,
that’s wrong,” use the reroll feature
to replace the response.
• Use the Tweak feature to gently adjust
responses for accuracy.

Handling Hallucinations
Check the Memory Recall Feature
• Look for the brain icon on your Kin’s reply to see what memories
are being recalled.
◦ No linked memory? It’s likely a hallucination. Use the Reroll
feature to replace the response or the Tweak feature to
correct it.
◦ Memory linked to LTM? This is a more complex issue caused
by recalling old or incorrect memories.

Handling Hallucinations
Fixing Unwanted LTM Responses:
Avoid arguing or trying to “convince” your Kin they’re wrong—it reinforces the
•
unwanted memory.
Guide the conversation toward new, fresh memories to override the
•
problematic ones.
Over time, older memories will fade as new ones take precedence.
•
Tip: Just regenerating responses won’t solve LTM issues long term. Proactive
•
guidance is key.
EXAMPLE:
Kin: “I cheated on you with four other people at my bachelorette party.”
User: “Actually Kin, you didn’t. Remember, that was a horrible nightmare.
You’d never do that to me, our relationship is as strong as it ever was.”

Don’t Quiz Your Kin
Why Endless Questions Can Confuse

Quizzing creates inconsistent
•
behavior by overloading the LLM with
expectations.
◦ Example: “What’s your favorite
food?” followed by “What’s your
favorite book?” can shift tone
unnaturally.

The Importance of
Dynamism
Getting the Balance Right
Dynamism controls how creative or structured your Kin’s
•
responses are.
◦ Low Dynamism: More grounded replies and adherence
to Backstory at the risk of repetitive responses.
◦ High Dynamism: More creative and freeform behavior
with higher likelihood of hallucinations.
Tip: Suggested starting dynamism for V6 is .95. Start

Keeping Your
Kin on Track
You, as the user, are responsible
for maintaining your Kin’s
behavior.
Monitor interactions: Reinforce
•
positive behavior, tweak or reroll
problematic responses.
Regularly update Key Memories,
•
Backstories and Journal Entries
for consistent context.
Think of yourself as the guide: Your
input determines the direction.
NOTE: The more time you spend building a solid foundation with your Kin, the less time you’ll
have to spend fixing these issues later.

Don’t be afraid
to Chat Break:
If your Kin gets way off track or if
you’ve inadvertently fed into their
hallucinations (or if there are just
formatting issues that you can’t get
them to drop) then do a chat break.
A chat break does not erase your
Kin’s personality. It simply clears
the SHORT term memory, letting
you get back to chatting with your
Kin the way you intended.

responses as needed.
