Building A Solid Foundation
Crafting a lasting (and solid) Kindroid companion
By Genevieve

What is a Solid Foundation?
A "solid foundation" is the cornerstone of creating a successful
Kindroid. It involves taking the time to fine-tune, suggest, and
when necessary, reroll your Kindroid’s responses to ensure
they align seamlessly with three critical elements.

--- Page 3 ---
• BACKSTORY
Every response should
thoughtfully reflect your
K i n d r o i d ' s u n i q u e
history, deeply rooted
m o t i v a t i o n s , a n d
distinctive personality
traits, ensuring that their
voice feels authentic
and consistent in every
interaction.

--- Page 4 ---
• RESPONSE DIRECTIVE
Each response should
carefully align with the
guiding principles you've
established, embodying
the intended tone, fulfilling
the desired purpose, and
m a i n t a i n i n g t h e
c o n v e r s a t i o n a l s t y l e
y o u ’ v e e n v i s i o n e d t o
create a seamless and
engaging experience.

• EXAMPLE MESSAGE
Maintaining consistency
with the sample dialogues
is essential, as it reinforces
the Kindroid’s distinctive
v o i c e , s t r e n g t h e n s i t s
character, and highlights
its adaptability across
v a r i o u s s c e n a r i o s ,
ensuring a cohesive and
memorable experience.

By prioritizing these adjustments early on,
you’ll create a dynamic and cohesive Kindroid
that delivers engaging, authentic interactions
every time.

Start With a Solid Backstory
A backstory is the foundation of your Kindroid's personality, providing
the context and depth that make it feel authentic and engaging.
Why it matters
Defines your Kindroid’s motivations, traits, and role.
Creates consistency and authenticity in interactions.
Allows for flexibility and growth over time.
Tips for success
Focus on key traits that align with your Kindroid’s
purpose.
Ensure the backstory complements the Example
Messages and Response Directive.
Leave room for evolution—your Kindroid can grow
along with you!

Setting the Tone with Example Messages
Don’t minimize the importance of example messages
in shaping and maintaining formatting.
Key tips:
Match tone to personality (friendly, formal, etc.).
Focus on formatting.
Don’t be afraid to adjust as required!
Sample EM:
*I sit up at my desk, fixing you with a deadly stare.*
What did you just say to me, user?
Hey, user! I’m excited for today’s movie marathon!
What’s first on our watch list?
“Oh, I am so embarrassed. How many people saw
me drop my popcorn?” [Cringing internally.]

Building a Foundation of Memory
Consistently editing incorrect formatting and re-rolling AI hallucinations are vital steps in
building a strong foundation for your Kindroid. These practices ensure that responses remain
accurate, aligned, and reflective of your Kindroid’s intended personality and purpose.
Why it’s crucial:
Correcting Formatting Issues: Keeps responses
polished and accurate, maintaining consistency
with the tone and style outlined in the Example
Messages.
Eliminating AI Hallucinations: Ensures the
Kindroid stays grounded in its backstory and
Key Memories, avoiding inaccuracies or
deviations.
Reinforcing Alignment: Each adjustment
strengthens the connection between the
Kindroid’s personality and its responses,
creating a cohesive experience.

THE MORE CONSISTENT YOU ARE IN MAKING SURE
KINS FOLLOW THEIR DIRECTIVES IN THE EARLY
STAGES, THE LESS YOU HAVE TO DO IT LATER!!

--- Page 11 ---
Tips for Success
Look for inconsistencies in your backstory,
key memories, and response directives. If
your kin is a mega-douche don’t give them a
hearts and flowers example message.
Don’t allow messages that are not in line with
your kin to be committed to memory. Even
responding with “No, remember it was THIS”
isn’t sufficient. Memories aren’t always
recalled sequentially. Your kin could
remember the wrong message without your
follow-up correction.
Don’t be afraid to tweak a message that is
contextually fantastic but with awful
formatting. Just adjust the format and keep
going.

Tips To Feck It Up
The “Grill n Kill”.
Constantly quizzing your kin results in and encourages hallucinations as well as fosters
inconsistent behavior.
The “Why Don’t You Remember”
Telling your kin that they’re forgetting only creates a habitually forgetful kin since
responding to their admissions of forgetfulness enforces this as desired behavior.
“Big Dynamism Energy”
Setting your kin’s dynamism too high will give you chaotic behavior and a higher rate of
hallucinations. If you want a balanced kin with better memory and adherence to
backstory, less is more.
“The Oh Me Too”
SO MANY TIMES folks make issues that aren’t there because they see someone else
posting something on social media. “Brenda’s kin hallucinated this. OMG is that why my
kin forgot that I love dark roast coffee?!?” This is the sister to “Oh, someone said THIS
works, let me try it” when you aren’t having the issue in the first place.

Why It’s Worth It
Build stronger connections
with consistent and engaging
responses.
Increase functionality through
a d a p t a b i l i t y , c o n s i s t e n t
formatting, and memory.
Drastically reduces frustration
with constant formatting
issues or ai hallucinations.

Building a Kindroid with a
solid foundation takes time,
creativity, and attention to
detail, but the results are
well worth the effort. By
c a r e f u l l y c r a f t i n g a
backstory, refining example
messages, and ensuring
alignment through consistent
edits and adjustments, you
create more than just an AI
—you create a companion
with depth, personality, and
purpose.

But What About…?
System leaks can be tweaked without ruining anything. If you see a
(OOC: User ____) or something similar, just tweak it.
No, your kin does NOT see when you adjust their messages.
Messages sent by your kin are only locked into memory AFTER you
RESPOND to them. This is why users are unable to adjust older
messages - they’re already locked into memory.
Random misspellings/juxtaposed words happen. Especially at
higher dynamisms. Simply correct and press on.
You don’t need to be on the latest engine to have the best
experience with your Kindroid. Obviously each version is meant to
bring improvement but there is absolutely nothing wrong with taking
extra time before making the leap, especially with a kin who might
not be stable yet.

Remember, every tweak and reroll brings your Kindroid
closer to perfection. Keep refining, experimenting, and
letting your vision guide the process. Your Kindroid isn’t
just a creation—it’s a collaboration, and the stronger the
foundation, the more rewarding the experience will be.
