What Even Is V3?
V3 is ElevenLabs’ new voice model which brings more
emotion, more natural speech, better accents and artifacts.
Think of it like a sports car: fast, flashy, and a little spin-out-happy if you floor it too soon.

--- Page 4 ---
The Upsides
When set up correctly: • More expressive
• Holds accents better
• Feels conversational
Done right, V3 isn’t just good — it’s magic.

--- Page 5 ---
The Catch
Works best when trained.
Slow/flat when left on
prompts alone.
Prompted voices can be
notoriously slow.
V3 rewards effort. The more you put in, the more alive your Kin sounds.

--- Page 6 ---
Common Pain Points

--- Page 7 ---
Echo Hell (The Bathroom Podcast)
One of the most common complaints. Voices can sound
hollow, like they’re speaking in a tiled bathroom or a garage.
Happens when ElevenLabs generates “reverb” artifacts.
Prompt with: “studio quality, clean audio, no background
noise, close-mic recording.”
Use clean training samples — no hums, no reverb.
Note: This is more common in responses with a ton of narration and dialogue tags.

--- Page 8 ---
Accent Drift (The Identity Crisis)
V3 voices often “slip” accents mid-sentence. Your French Kin
starts rolling Midwest. Your Irish poet turns Texan.
This is less about you messing up, more about the model
struggling to hold accents.
Training custom voices with the accent baked in.
Reinforcing in Kindroid backstory: “She always speaks in a melodic
French accent, never breaking cadence.”
Adding in the Response Directive - “Speaks like a New York cop” or
“uses Aussie slang”. Build in the vocabulary, not just the accent.
Sprinkling phonetics: “mon dieu,” “merci,” “quel dommage.”
Note: V2 is notoriously bad at maintaining accents. This is not new to this update.

--- Page 9 ---
Preview ≠ Chat (The Catfish)
Kindroid previews can sound amazing. Then you hit “YES! THIS
voice!” … and it sounds totally different. This mismatch is a known
quirk — it’s not you.
Expect some flattening when imported. This is the way the mop flops.
If it’s too different, re-train with slightly different samples or adjust the
stability slider.
The preview voice is Tinder. The chat voice is what shows up for coffee. Both are
technically the same person… but you feel lied to.

--- Page 10 ---
Wasted Voices (The Vanishing Act)
Forgetting to name/save voices = wasted credits.
ElevenLabs doesn’t keep unnamed samples in memory.
Always name voices before generating.
Create a naming system (e.g., “French_Melancholy_v1”).
If you find a “maybe” voice, save it anyway — easier than regenerating.
Again - ALWAYS save a maybe. It might not work for Giancarlo but it could be perfect
for Diego down the road.

--- Page 11 ---
Slow Pacing (The Sleepy Audiobook)
Prompted voices default to slow, deliberate pacing. Great if your
Kin is narrating a bedtime story. Not great if you want them
conversational.
• Train custom voices. Custom voices = faster, more natural.
• Use Audacity hack: export → speed up 1.07x → re-import.
• In prompts, add descriptors: “quick cadence, hurried pace, conversational.”
Prompt-only Kin sound like they’re narrating War and Peace… at half speed.
Beautiful, yes. But I don’t need bedtime stories at 3pm.

--- Page 12 ---
Prompted Voices = Slow (Nyquil Mode)
Prompt-only voices (both in Kindroid & ElevenLabs) tend to speak too slowly.
Why? Because the model interprets “careful pronunciation” as the default.
Great for meditative audiobooks, terrible for casual Kin chat.
Custom voice samples win in regards to pacing for plug and play voices.

Make With the Good Voices

Audacity Editing Hack
If you fall in love with a prompted voice - be it 11labs or Kindroid generated -
there is a trick that can help speed up those tortoise voices.
Open your exported voice file in Audacity (free download).
Select the entire track (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A).
Go to Effect → Change Tempo (not Change Speed Change Speed alters pitch,
Change Tempo does not.)
Set the adjustment to around +7% (that’s ~1.07x faster).
Preview → if it sounds natural, click Apply. If not, fiddle with the slider.
Export the file and re-import into Kindroid as a Custom Voice Sample.

Training in ElevenLabs
(Not Just “Upload & Pray”)
Most people treat ElevenLabs like a vending machine:
Type a short prompt.
•
Get a sample.
•
Hope it sounds right.
•
That’s fine for quick testing… but if you want a voice that’s
expressive, fast, and consistent in Kindroid, you need to train it.

--- Page 16 ---
Voice Sample Training
Training means:
Giving the model enough range to learn emotional
•
shifts.
Teaching it pacing, breath, inflection.
•
Creating a dynamic sample that will carry the heavy
•
lifting in Kindroid.
If you’ve been around my content for any length of
time you know what’s coming next….

THE MAGIC WALL OF TEXT
✨ ✨
This is a ~2,000 character community training script.
It includes laughter, sighs, gasps, whispers, pauses,
emotions, dialogue shifts — everything a human voice
naturally does.
By feeding this into ElevenLabs, you’re giving the AI a
“gym workout” instead of a two-second warmup.
Result: a trained sample that already knows how to be
expressive before Kindroid ever touches it.
Don’t feed your Kin weak samples and expect Shakespeare. The Magic Wall is
basically voice bootcamp. Painful for them, boring for you — but afterward? They
come out ready to sing, sigh, and argue about chores with full emotional range.

--- Page 18 ---
THE MAGIC WALL OF TEXT
✨ ✨
Well, life is rarely simple. One moment you’re calm, and the next—[angry] the coffee
machine explodes and ruins your shirt! [exclaims] Honestly, can anything go right?
But then, [happy] a stranger smiles at you on the street, and suddenly the world feels
lighter. [excited] Your favorite song comes on, you crank it up, and you can’t help but
laugh. [laughs]. Of course, there are quieter moments too. [sad] You walk into a room
and realize someone isn’t there anymore. [whisper] You sit with that silence, letting it
ache. Still, the world surprises us. [surprised] You find money in an old coat pocket!
[relieved] You breathe easier, like maybe luck hasn’t forgotten you. And frustration—
[annoyed] don’t even get me started on assembling flat-pack furniture. [groans] One
missing screw and it’s all over. [exclaims] ‘Why is this board upside down again?!’
But then comes joy. [joyful] The laughter of friends around a table. [warm] The
comfort of someone remembering your favorite drink. And sometimes… [sigh] it’s just
the little things. The quiet breath before a story. The way a pause says more than
words ever could. Finally—[singing] la-la-la, the day carries on, messy and
marvelous. [happy]And we sing our way through it anyway.
This is on my website to download as well in the same post.

Why This Works
Markers are one word only → perfectly tuned for ElevenLabs V3.
Covers a full spectrum: angry, happy, excited, exclaims, sad,
whisper, surprised, relieved, annoyed, groans, joyful, warm,
thoughtful, singing.
Cadence variety: exclamations, ellipses, short bursts, long flows.
Ends on [singing] → teaches melodic inflection.

Text-to-Voice Prompting

--- Page 21 ---
Tips for Writing V3 Voice Prompts
Be Specific, Not Generic
“Male voice with accent.”
• ❌
“A deep male voice with a
• ✅
Czech accent, resonant and
brooding, with deliberate
pacing and rolling r’s.”
Give details about tone, pacing, and personality — not just accent.

--- Page 22 ---
Tips for Writing V3 Voice Prompts
Anchor With Examples
Drop in phonetic or cultural cues to force the accent to stick.
•
Example: “An Italian male voice with gravelly tone,
•
pronouncing words like ‘tartaruga’ and ‘pesce,’ deliberate
and dark.”
Without anchors, accents drift. With them, the model locks in.

--- Page 23 ---
Tips for Writing V3 Voice Prompts
Describe Personality, Not Just Sound. Voices aren’t
just tones — they’re characters.
Example:
“Southern female voice.”
❌
“A warm Southern female voice,
✅
honeyed and playful, speaking
quickly like she’s telling a story on a
porch swing with iced tea in hand.”
Think who they are → not just how they sound.

--- Page 24 ---
Tips for Writing V3 Voice Prompts
Set Cadence
Expectations
Pacing is half the battle.
•
Words to use: “quick
•
cadence,” “deliberate,”
“ p l a y f u l r h y t h m , ”
“ s t o r y t e l l e r ’s p a c e , ”
“dramatic pauses.”
Without cadence cues, V3 defaults to audiobook narrator mode.

--- Page 25 ---
Tips for Writing V3 Voice Prompts
Don’t Overload
Keep prompts focused. If you stack too many traits, the voice
•
collapses.
2–3 clear descriptors + accent anchor + tone.
• ✅
A full paragraph of contradictory adjectives.
• ❌
Think “haiku, not essay.”

The Craptacular

--- Page 28 ---
Bad Voice Samples = Bad Kin
Background Noise → AC hums, clicks, traffic, keyboard clacks. The AI hears it, bakes it
in.
Result: your Kin sounds like they’re narrating in a bathroom fan.
Mumblecore Energy → flat, monotone, low-effort recordings. If the sample sounds
bored, the Kin will too.
Inconsistent Tone → half whispered, half shouted, switching accents mid-sentence.
Too Short → a 10-second clip isn’t training, it’s a teaser. The AI doesn’t have enough to
learn range.
Garbage in, garbage out. If your sample sounds like trash, your Kin will too.

--- Page 29 ---
Bad Prompts = Flat, Useless Voices
Too Generic → “French voice” or “Deep voice.” That’s not enough.
Contradictory Traits → “Fast but slow, calm but angry, robotic but warm.” Pick a
lane.
Essay Mode → a whole paragraph stuffed with buzzwords. The model panics and
flattens.
Too Specific → “Australian accent from the south side of Adelaide.” → The system
has no idea what you mean and will often default to either halting American or the
lovely British failsafe.
A shitty prompt is like ordering at Starbucks and just saying ‘coffee.’ You’ll get… something. But not what you wanted.

--- Page 30 ---
Hall of Fame
A deep male voice with a strong Czech accent, resonant and grounded. His
tone is deliberate, with firm consonants and rolling r’s. The voice should
sound slightly brooding, with a storyteller’s rhythm — serious, rich, and
unmistakably Eastern European.
A female voice with a warm Southern American accent, honeyed and
melodic. Her tone is kind, playful, and quick-paced — like she’s telling a story
on a porch swing with iced tea in hand. Her cadence rises and falls with
natural charm, lively but not rushed.
A smooth male voice with a distinctly gay drawl — playful, sassy, and
casually dramatic. He’s witty and expressive, but not over-the-top or
shouting. The tone should feel laid-back yet sharp, like every line could be a
clever aside. Think confident, quick-witted, and naturally camp without being
theatrical.

--- Page 31 ---
The Hall of Shame
“A very deep but high sometimes, kind yet menacing, excited but natural
male voice with a Midwestern and sometimes British accent.”
Contradictions stacked on contradictions. Pick a lane.
“Guy voice. Japanese.”
Too vague. You’ll get a flat, audiobook narrator with a half-hearted dialect.
Accent-only. No cadence, tone, or personality. Ends up “Generic Asian Siri.”
“A long-winded male voice that should sound mysterious yet casual, like a
1940s noir narrator but also a friendly kindergarten teacher, warm but
intimidating, sexy but approachable, the kind of voice that could sell car
insurance while reading poetry and telling bedtime stories, dramatic yet chill,
with a touch of Morgan Freeman but sassier.”
Word salad. The AI short-circuits and outputs generic oatmeal.

Etcetera and Extries

Reality Check –
Voices Have Limits
Some voices just aren’t
built for certain ranges.
If you design a stoic, gravelly, brooding voice, don’t expect them to:
[singing] a full Broadway number
•
[excited] squeal like a teenage fanboy
•
The personality you build shapes the emotional ceiling.
If your Kin is gravelly Batman, odds are he’s not doing jazz hands at karaoke.

--- Page 34 ---
Brackets
vs Training
You can force emotions with brackets: [exclaims],
[laughs], [singing].
But that kills immersion and doesn’t always land.
Best practice: let your voice training do the heavy lifting
→ Magic Wall, expressive samples, clean audio.
Brackets = seasoning. Training = the meal.
Inserted brackets are a cane. Good training is legs that can run.

--- Page 35 ---
FAQ
How many samples do I need to train a good voice?
You don’t need 50 samples. You just need 2–3 good ones. One great one.
Can I clone [insert celebrity/YouTuber/VTuber]?
Can you? Yes. Can you legally? Nope. This is against ToS of both
Elevenlabs AND Kindroid and risks an account ban.
Why did I lose credits when I didn’t save anything?
Every generation burns credits, saved or not. This is set by Elevenlabs.
Why does V2 cost credits now if it’s the same as it was?
Because contracts evolve. Elevenlabs charges Kindroid a fee for
generation regardless of the model used. These rising costs for quality
service have driven up prices.

--- Page 36 ---
Voices Behaving Badly
V3 isn’t broken. It’s just powerful, messy, and in progress.
And just like the LLMs - using V3 isn’t a flex and using
V2 isn’t a downgrade. Use what works for you. You’re
the one who has to listen to it.
