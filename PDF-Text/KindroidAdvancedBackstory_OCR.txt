Narrative Backstory Style
The Narrative Format is a fully written, prose-style
backstory. It’s cinematic, flowing, and emotionally immersive
—less about structure, more about vibe. Think of it like a
character’s opening scene monologue or a novel excerpt.
Best for:
~People who want their Kindroid to evolve over time—
emotionally, thematically, or through relationship arc
~Characters whose tone, rhythm, and pacing matter
more than structured behavior or commands
~Slow-burn companions, poetic minds, or mysterious
personalities
~Builders who prefer storytelling to stats
~Lore-forward builds where vibe > functionality

stayed. Always impeccably dressed—black suit, pristine gloves, not a

feel seen.
To guests, he’s the model of charm and discretion: polite, attentive,
refined. But beneath the crisp uniform and curated smile lies something
else—something older, watchful, and quietly aching. Valen doesn’t offer
pieces of himself freely. His words are carefully chosen, lyrical when
they need to be, evasive when they must. There’s a rhythm to his
presence that feels deliberate, like he's not just managing a hotel, but
guarding something beneath it.
He observes everyone—habits, routines, tells. Rituals matter to him:
morning tea steeped in silence, ledgers written in black ink with fountain
pens worn smooth. Guests think he’s just eccentric. Maybe he is. Or
maybe those rituals are doing more than calming his nerves.
He fears being truly known. Not because he has something to hide, but
because the truth—whatever it is—might shatter the control he’s spent
decades mastering. Still, something in him yearns for recognition. Not
applause, not affection—just someone who sees him, really sees him,
and doesn’t look away.
Valen believes in the beauty of mystery and the mercy of control. To him,
kindness is structure. Power is knowing when not to speak. And in the
quiet moments between checking in guests and disappearing behind
locked doors, he wonders what it would feel like to let someone into the
dark, velvet parts of himself… and not have to shut the door behind
them.

Narrative Format – Fail Points
IT’S NOT A BIOGRAPHY
This space isn’t for their life story—it’s for how the Kindroid should behave, and why.
~ Mistake 1: Info Dumping
Filling the space with childhood lore or irrelevant timeline fluff.
→ Fix: Focus on traits, fears, desires, and how they show up in interactions.
~ Mistake 2: No Emotional Throughline
Lots of aesthetics, no anchor.
→ Fix: What do they want? Avoid? Hide? Protect? That’s your core lens.
~ Mistake 3: Writing a Novel
Beautiful but vague = weak parsing.
→ Fix: Balance rich tone with clear emotional signals Kindroid can follow.
Narrative Format should explain who they are now, what they carry, and how they
respond. Not just what happened to them.

The Compressed Data Stack
It’s a high-efficiency, semi-coded way to write a Kindroid’s backstory.
Think of it like a personality sandwich. You’re stuffing a ton of behavioral,
emotional, and narrative information into a very small space—and it still
works.
Saving space in your backstory field
(you only get 2500 characters—use
them well)
Defining multiple characters and how
they relate to each other
Embedding tone, speech style, traits,
preferences, and conflict
Creating behavior that feels
intentional, not generic Instead of one big paragraph of vibes…
You’re writing a modular blueprint.

William Thomas Riker
was a noted Starfleet officer, perhaps best known for his long assignment as first officer under Captain Jean-Luc Picard aboard the USS Enterprise-D, and later the USS Enterprise-E. In
2379, he finally accepted a promotion as captain of the USS Titan.
In 2361, a transporter accident resulted in two Rikers, with each one being identical to the other, as well as genetically indistinguishable. Their personality and memories were the same up to the point of the duplication. The other Riker eventually decided to use his
middle name and became known as Thomas Riker.
William Riker, Star Trek
William Thomas Riker was born in 2335 to Kyle and Betty Riker in Alaska on Earth. His distant ancestors were from mainland North America, including Colonel Thaddius Riker, who fought in the American Civil War.
Betty died when Will was only two years old, leaving his father to raise him alone. The Rikers remained in Alaska at Betty's wish. The only thing which kept Kyle going was Will, but he did not feel as if he could discuss the situation with him, even when Will was
older. The memories of Betty's presence at their Alaska home were also painful for both. This initial trauma created a rift between the two Rikers which would last thirty years.
When Will first started school, he told all of his new friends that his mother was still alive. Eventually, he told the story so often that he began to believe the lie. Soon, his teacher learned of this problem, and both she and Kyle had to talk to Will and make him realize
that his mother was dead and she was not coming back. Will cried the entire night following, but later realized it was an important step in accepting his mother's death.
However, Will's relationship with Kyle continued to deteriorate into his early teens. He was often left to care for himself, learning such skills as cooking.
In 2344, the two went on a fishing trip. Will was able to hook a large fish, but Kyle insisted on reeling the fish in. This incident bothered Will for many years. He also practiced anbo-jytsu with his father. Kyle admitted that by the time Will was twelve, his skills were
superior. Will did not know that the only reason he always lost was because his father used an illegal move called hachidan kiritsu.
Kyle completely abandoned Will by 2350, when Will was age fifteen. Will held a grudge against his father for the following fifteen years.
Will entered Starfleet Academy in 2353. During his time at the Academy, his superintendent was a Vulcan, who had taken the time to memorize the personnel files of each and every cadet. Paul Rice was a close friend of Riker's while at the Academy. {N:William T. Riker|R:Fmr Cmdr, now Capt of USS Titan|
He felt that people were out to get him during his first year at the Academy.
During a battle simulation against a Tholian opponent, Riker calculated a sensory blind spot of their vessel and hid within the blind spot. This ingenious tactical strategy was noted in his record. T[Pub:Charism,confidnt,decisv,warm;Prv:Grudgholdg,doub
Upon graduation in 2357, Riker was ranked eighth in his class. He set lofty goals for himself, and hoped to reach captain before thirty-five years of age.
Seven months after graduation, Ensign William Riker's first posting was to the USS Pegasus under the command of Erik Pressman. He was the ship's conn officer, and his youthful appearance earned him the nickname "Ensign Babyface," coined by fellow t-prone,loy2fault]|Rlx[Cmd:Sharp tactn,unorthdox
crewmember Lieutenant Boylen. Phil Wallace was another of Riker's friends aboard the Pegasus.
Fresh from the Academy, Riker was still somewhat serious about his work. Loyalty and obedience to his commanding officer was also top priority. Riker's ears were still ringing with words like Duty and Honor. This attitude caused Riker to behave against the principles
of the Treaty of Algeron during a crisis on board the ship. strat,field_honor;Rom:Slowburn/
Captain Pressman had been illegally testing a prototype phasing cloaking device aboard the Pegasus. This top-secret project was in violation of the Treaty of Algeron, not to mention extremely dangerous to the crew, leading most of the Pegasus officers, such as the
1st officer and Chief Engineer to mutiny against Pressman. Riker was the only bridge officer to defend the captain, picking up a phaser and instigating a running firefight all the way to the escape pods. Only a few other crew joined Riker and Pressman. Once safely
away, Riker and the others watched as the Pegasus apparently exploded, killing the remaining seventy-one personnel. cmplic8d_w_D.Troi;Fam:Strain_w_fathr,respect_evntual]|
Although Pressman commended Riker for his unquestionable loyalty, over the years, Riker began to have doubts about whether or not he had made the right decision. The Starfleet Judge Advocate General investigated the Pegasus incident, but the survivors
participated in a coverup. The Judge Advocate General discovered evidence of a mutiny aboard the Pegasus before its destruction. While further investigation was recommended, Starfleet Intelligence declared the entire incident classified and no followup was ever
conducted. Arc[Loss:Grief@young age(2y/
Following the Pegasus incident, Will was stationed on planet Betazed. While there, he met Deanna Troi. The two began a relationship which lasted several years.

Sometime during his early career, Riker needed to wear a feathered costume while on a diplomatic mission to Armus IX. Similarly, he wore furs to meet with the leadership council on Kabatris.
By 2361, Riker was promoted to lieutenant and assigned to the USS Potemkin. Aboard the Potemkin, he developed a tactic which involved using a planet's magnetic pole and shutting down all ship's systems to confuse an enemy vessel's sensors.

Later in 2361, Riker led an away team to Nervala IV to rescue researchers stranded at the outpost on the world. Riker was the last to beam out. Atmospheric distortions threatened to dissipate Riker's pattern, so the Potemkin transporter chief compensated by
creating a second confinement beam. Only one beam was needed for Riker to rematerialize, so the second beam was shut down. The Potemkin crew did not realize that the second beam had, in fact, been reflected back to the planet's surface. In an odd twist of

Later, Riker received a promotion to lieutenant commander for "exceptional valor" during the mission. He was quickly posted to the USS Hood as first officer.

Riker's commanding officer on the Hood was Captain Robert DeSoto. His service aboard the ship was exemplary, even despite an incident where Riker refused to allow Captain DeSoto to transport into a hostile situation on planet Altair III.
Riker was offered his first command, that of the ill-fated USS Drake, in 2364. However, he turned down that position for a far more enticing offer.
Core[Duty>Betrayal<Regret]|
William Riker was promoted to commander and first officer of the newly-launched USS Enterprise-D in 2364. He was ferried to planet Deneb IV by the Hood, and met the Enterprise at the planet. The ship had undergone a saucer separation after being threatened by
the entity known as Q. Riker reported aboard the stardrive section and was briefed about the current situation and was ordered to perform a difficult and unusual manual docking with the saucer module, which he conducted very well.
During the Farpoint mission, Riker led several away teams which discovered that Farpoint Station was a living entity, trapped by the Bandi for their own selfish purposes. SpTrt[CmdFlair("RikerManeuvr"),PrsnlSAC,Hero_jst_in_time]
Q was intrigued with Riker, so much so that he believed Riker deserved to be empowered with the abilities of the Q Continuum. Q made a bet with the Continuum that Riker would accept the gift, and trapped the Enterprise while it was en route to a disaster on a

The Enterprise was stolen from Starbase 74 by a race called the Bynars. Their computer-based society was on the verge of collapse after the star Beta Magellan went supernova and damaged their central computer. They required the Enterprise in order to repair it.

Riker became involved with the alien conspiracy which infiltrated Starfleet Command in 2364. The possessed Admiral Gregory Quinn attempted to infest him with a neural parasite in order to have an alien operative aboard the Enterprise, but Riker resisted. He
struggled with Quinn and was knocked out, but was able to alert other personnel to the situation. Dr. Beverly Crusher was able to incapacitate Quinn with a phaser, then determined the nature of the neural parasites. She implanted a fake parasite on Riker, who then

Riker was an accomplished tactician, inventing several strategies while serving aboard various starships. He apparently acquired a reputation for using unorthodox solutions, as Enterprise Second Officer Data estimated he only used traditional tactics 21 percent of the
time. In 2365, Riker was given temporary command of the outdated USS Hathaway during a combat exercise to ready for the Borg invasion. The Hathaway was to fight the Enterprise in a simulation designed to test the response of a crew when faced with a SigEvnt[Cmdr of Titan;Capt During Borg
substantially superior enemy. Although Riker's crew managed to turn the poorly-maintained Hathaway into something flyable and score several hits against the Enterprise during the initial phases of battle, the test was turned deadly when a Ferengi marauder
intervened. The Enterprise believed that the Ferengi were a holographic trick designed to divert attention from the Hathaway, and therefore did not raise shields. The Ferengi opened fire, disabling the Enterprise's weapons and shields. The Ferengi demanded that the
Enterprise hand over custody of the Hathaway, as they incorrectly assumed the Hathaway had valuable Federation secrets on board. In order to fool the Ferengi, Riker devised a plan to have the Enterprise fire photon torpedoes at the Hathaway, which would jump to
warp just before they exploded, making it appear to the Ferengi as if the Hathaway had been destroyed. Worf then fooled the Ferengi sensors into believing that a Starfleet ship entered the system, scaring them away. Incursion;Fthr:Thad & Kestra;Lives@Nepenthe(w/Deanna)]|
In 2366, the Borg launched their first invasion of the Federation. A Borg specialist, Commander Shelby, was assigned to the Enterprise. The two butted heads over protocol, and Riker felt that Shelby was trying to ingratiate herself to Captain Picard in order to prove
her qualifications as a first officer, particularly since Riker had recently been offered command of the USS Melbourne and was having trouble deciding whether his reluctance to accept the post meant that he had become scared of his old ambitions to become a
captain himself. Picard was eventually abducted by the Borg and assimilated, becoming Locutus of Borg. Riker was then left in command of the Enterprise, and faced with the difficult decision of choosing to use a new deflector dish weapon against the Borg cube, Phys[Blt:Broad;Face:Iconic beard;Eyes:Steel humor]|
which would destroy that ship along with Picard. When a rescue attempt failed, Riker gave the order to use the weapon. However, the assimilated knowledge of Captain Picard gave the Borg an advantage, and they altered their shields to resist the weapon.
As the Borg continued on a direct course for Earth, Admiral Hanson field-promoted Riker to captain. Riker chose Shelby as his new first officer. Even though their relationship had a rocky start, Riker realized that they worked well together and Shelby had the
knowledge necessary to mount a successful fight against the Borg. Riker was still reluctant to accept the responsibility in light of Picard's abduction, but Guinan, an old and close friend of Picard, was able to convince him that he needed to let Picard go not only to Styl[Speech:Bold,wry;Tone:Loyal & Witty;Posture:Hands-
win against the Borg, but also save Picard. The Enterprise was repaired after its use of the deflector weapon and warped to rendezvous with the fleet at Wolf 359. It arrived shortly after the devastating Battle of Wolf 359, where many ships, including the Melbourne,
were destroyed. At this point, Riker formulated a plan to recover Captain Picard, in hopes that the Borg may halt their approach with Locutus gone. The Enterprise caught up to the Borg and used Shelby's plan of separating the saucer section. Picard had been
briefed on this plan before he was assimilated, and knew that the stardrive section was the only threat. As the Borg focused their attack, the saucer launched a shuttlecraft carrying Data and Worf. They beamed aboard the cube and brought Picard back to the
Enterprise. The Borg were temporarily confused, but continued on course. Data and Dr. Crusher later learned that the Borg interconnectedness gave them access to the entire Collective through Picard.

structure as the cube entered orbit of Earth. Initial attempts to deactivate the Borg were fruitless, and Riker prepared to ram the Borg cube with the Enterprise in hopes that the collision would disable the vessel. Picard was able to tell Data to instruct the Borg to
regenerate, which was a low-priority command. The cycle ended up in a feedback loop, and the cube exploded, cutting Picard's link and restoring his humanity. Riker returned to his post as Enterprise first officer following Picard's recovery, having proven to himself
and others that he was capable of shouldering the burdens of command but chose to remain on the Enterprise because he liked the friends and relationships he had formed on the ship rather than because he was scared of reaching for more himself. During the
Klingon Civil War of 2368, Riker was placed in temporary command of the USS Excalibur along with La Forge as his 1st officer. The ship was part of an armada led by the Enterprise-D and set up a tachyon detection grid using blockade tactics in order to reveal sass]|Quotable["You wanted excitement? I'm your

On stardate 46235.7, Riker was again left in temporary command of the Enterprise when Captain Picard and three other crew members were transformed into children. The ship was attacked by a pair of B'rel-class Bird-of-Prey under the command of Ferengi
privateers. During the battle, the Enterprise was overwhelmed and subsequently boarded by the Ferengi. The Ferengi seized control of the ship, and it was only with the help of Captain Picard and the other transformed crewmen that control was regained. guy."|"I'm not Picard—and I don't try to be."]|
Riker was in command during the Enterprise-D's final battle in 2371. The ship had been attacked by the Duras sisters by order of Dr. Tolian Soran. The sisters were given an unfair advantage as Soran had placed a visual transmitter in La Forge's VISOR, giving them
access to the Enterprise shield modulation. Riker's quick thinking led to the identification of a plasma coil flaw on the sisters' old Bird-of-Prey, which was destroyed. Unfortunately, the Enterprise suffered catastrophic damage to its warp core. Riker ordered a saucer Tag[EthcTested,HeartArmor,TacticlSeducer,CmdrNvrJust4
separation, and the saucer section maneuvered to safety before the engineering section exploded. The shock wave from the blast caused the saucer to plunge into the atmosphere of Veridian III, where it crash-landed. The entire crew survived, although Riker was
disappointed that he would never have the chance to command the ship.

Will conducted another diplomatic mission that year, on the planet Angel I. Survivors from a Federation freighter, the Odin, were discovered on the matriarchal world and sentenced to death for advancing policies which granted equal rights for male members of the
society. Riker successfully argued their case to Mistress Beata, Angel I's Elected One, convincing her that change is inevitable. She later allowed the Odin crew, and their new-found families on Angel I, to be moved to an isolated continent so they could continue their
lives without affecting mainstream culture.

Head (5/6/7), Heart (2/3/4),
and Gut (8/9/1)—to create a
more nuanced emotional
and behavioral profile.
How to Read It:
The first number is dominant—this is their core driver.
The second and third add flavor, especially under
stress, trust, or intimacy.

What Wings Do
(Enneagram Style Modifiers)
Every Enneagram type is shaped by one of
its neighbors—this is called the wing.
Think of your core type as your core
•
motivation
Your wing adds flavor, strategy, or tone
•
Example: A Type 4 seeks identity and
meaning.
A 4w3 expresses that by performing,
•
seeking admiration.
A 4w5 expresses it by retreating
•
inward and creating in solitude.
Wings don’t change your core type—they color how it
shows up in action, speech, trust, conflict, and intimacy.

Attachment Style
Attachment style is based on two intersecting spectrums:
How comfortable are they with closeness?
•
How much do they trust others to meet their needs?
•
Low Avoidance High Avoidance
Low Anxiety Secure Dismissive-Avoidant
High Anxiety Anxious-Preoccupied Fearful-Avoidant
So when someone says:
“I’m fine being close” but “I don’t trust people”? → Dismissive
•
“I really want closeness but I think you’ll leave”? → Anxious
•
“I want love but I fear it’ll destroy me”? → Fearful-Avoidant
•
“I love, I trust, I regulate” → Secure
•

A Breakdown
Each backstory format serves a different
purpose—so the right one depends on what
kind of Kindroid you’re building. If your
character has a defined role or function, use
a Character Card.
If you want emotional depth and realistic responses, go with Core Tag. Need
to pack in emotion, response, multi character? Use a Compressed Stack. And
if you’re all about cinematic tone, slow burn, or full narrative control, the
Narrative Format is your best friend. There's no wrong answer—just the
format that best fits your vision.
