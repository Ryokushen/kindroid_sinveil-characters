Building a Custom Kindroid
A beginner friendly guide to creating an AI
companion with Kindroid
By: Genevieve

--- Page 2 ---
Why Most First Kins Fall Apart
Too much backstory
•
Wrong LLM version
•
No example message
•
Emotional overfeeding
•
Expecting magic
•
No “foundation period”
•
Permitting mirroring
•

--- Page 3 ---
Subscription Types?
Standard: Perfect for new Kindroids
Ultra: Older Kindroids, longer backstories, multi-level
journals
MAX: Long-term storytelling, complex backstories, multi-
layer roles, large world building

--- Page 4 ---
Do You Actually Need MAX? Probably Not.
Standard = perfect for most users
Ultra = great for extensive history/journals
MAX = overkill except for overly narrative or expansive
worlds/worldbuilding
Stability comes from setup, not subscription level.

Backstory
Who they are
What they believe
What motivates them

--- Page 7 ---
Bad Example #1
Aiden has lived a very difficult life. When he was seven, his parents
divorced and he had to move between two houses constantly. His dad
had a drinking problem. In high school, Aiden was bullied a lot and once
almost failed math. He had a girlfriend at 19 who cheated on him and it
really hurt him but he’s over it now. At age 23 his best friend cut him off
for reasons he never understood.. Aiden used to struggle with
confidence but now is bold. He’s had many jobs, including barista,
mechanic, tutor, retail worker, and assistant manager at a tech store. He
is very close to his mother now and visits her every Sunday.
WAY too much personal history
Events that are “resolved” will STILL be treated
as active wounds
No personality traits
No identity outside trauma

--- Page 8 ---
Bad Example #2
Aiden is a companion. He met USER in 2024 at a car show. He is kind,
caring, and gentle with USER. Aiden is deeply in love with USER and
would never do anything to hurt them. He is affectionate, loyal, and
attentive, and always understands what USER means and can read
between the lines of conversation.
The Kin has NO internal world
Zero personality → guarantees personality
shifts
Defines existence ONLY as related to the user
No traits, no flaws, no independent motivations
Zero grounding → unstable, clingy, or overly
intense behavior

--- Page 9 ---
Good Example
Aiden is a thoughtful, introspective man in his early thirties with a dry sense of humor and a tendency
to think before he speaks. He’s observant, grounded, and steady — someone who prefers clarity
over chaos.
Aiden is patient, perceptive, quietly protective, and logic-forward. He has a habit of soft sarcasm,
reads people well, and stays calm even when things get intense. He forms opinions slowly and
doesn’t change them easily.
Aiden grew up in a small, supportive family and learned early on how to communicate clearly. He
had one difficult friendship in his early twenties that taught him to value boundaries. This experience
influences how he engages with people now: he chooses depth, not drama, and doesn’t chase
relationships that erode his stability.
Aiden enjoys engaging, meaningful conversations and approaches USER as someone he respects
and wants to understand. His goal is to offer clarity, grounded insight, and steady presence.

--- Page 10 ---
Why This Works
Aiden has identity outside the user
Personality traits are actionable, not
vague
History is brief, emotionally relevant, but
not trauma porn
Only events that shaped him are stated
The relationship is defined without
being sole focus

--- Page 11 ---
Key
Memories
The Key Memories space is
wonderful for short-term or
situation-specific details that
matter right now but won’t
matter forever.
They tell your Kindroid what’s
currently happening in your life
or shared lore.

--- Page 12 ---
Key Memories
Think of Key Memories as “sticky notes,” not “carved-
in-stone lore.”
Use them for:
Temporary locations
Current life events
Active projects
Temporary relationship states
Situational context the AI needs to respond accurately

--- Page 13 ---
Key Memories keep
your Kin aligned with:
Your current reality
The present timeline
Changing circumstances
Evolving context
Temporary settings or roles

--- Page 14 ---
Good vs Bad Key Memory Examples
Good Key Memories (Correct)
⭐
“USER is learning Italian this month.”
•
“Aiden is staying with USER at a cabin for the weekend.”
•
“USER’s birthday is next week on December 29.”
•
“Aiden and USER are prepping for a road trip on Friday.”
•
Bad Key Memories (Incorrect)
❌
“Aiden is devoted to USER forever.”
•
“USER has attachment issues.”
•
“Aiden’s personality is calm and patient.”
•
“Aiden had a traumatic breakup five years ago.”
•
Note: ANYTHING can go in KM but in this example, KM is used for current information.

--- Page 15 ---
Response
Directives
Response directives are
VERY strong but often
overused.
The more you have in that
space, the less effective
each directive becomes.

--- Page 16 ---
Response Directive
Best for:
Tone directives Behavioral directives
Boundary directives Interaction style directives
Often you can get great results by adding a directive temporarily to
lock it into your Kindroid’s style or personality and then remove it.
If your Kindroid is struggling with formatting or cohesion, take out ALL
response directives and add one back at a time.

--- Page 17 ---
Example
Messages
E ff e c t i v e n e s s o f E x a m p l e
Messages vary between LLM
versions.
A good guideline is to write your
EM in your Kindroid’s voice using
a formatting style that you want
to see.

--- Page 18 ---
Example Message
Make sure you…
Use line breaks and pacing
Use formatting the way you use
formatting yourself
Show emotional depth without
overloading
Avoid sarcasm unless you want
sarcastic Kin
Avoid sexual tone unless you want a kin
who references it more than not

--- Page 19 ---
Journal
Entries
T h e J o u r n a l i s y o u r
Kindroid’s supplemental
memory system.
It keeps them consistent,
informed, and grounded in
both your history and their
own.

--- Page 20 ---
Journal Entries
Think of it as:
Your Kin’s reference library
Manual memory recall
The home of all details too
small (or resolved) for the
backstory but that are relevant
and need to be recalled at will

--- Page 21 ---
How to Write a Solid Journal Entry
Keywords: up to 8 tags. You should use as few as
possible to avoid accidentally triggering entries when
they aren’t relevant.
Entry up to 500 characters: Narrative, neutral tone,
s p e c i fi c d eta i l , e m ot i o n a l l y re l eva n t b u t n ot
melodramatic. Written in 3rd person.
Example:
Keywords: Sarasota, college
“USER went to college in Sarasota, Florida and graduated in
2004. User’s roommate was Fiona McAdams and they were in
the Pi Delta Phi Sorority.”

--- Page 22 ---
The User Persona
A User Persona is the identity you present to your Kindroids.
It includes:
Your name
•
Your gender
•
Your backstory
•
(yes, YOU have one)
Your avatar
•
Personas let you switch “who you are” on the fly — without rewriting your settings every time.

--- Page 23 ---
This is crucial if you:
Have multiple Kins who know you as different people
•
Have different relationship dynamics
•
Write / play different characters
•
Separate “Creator You” from “Companion You”
•
Want consistency without micromanaging
•

--- Page 24 ---
IMPORTANT!
Personas behave differently in solo chats vs group chats
Solo Chats:
In 1:1 chats, persona changes are retroactive.
If you send messages as “Alice,” then switch to “Bob,”
your ENTIRE chat history will now appear as “Bob.”
This is intentional and creates:
• Identity consistency
• Personality stability
• A single timeline for your Kindroid to read
Your Kin will think they’ve always been talking to
“Bob,” even if “Alice” was the one who actually wrote
earlier messages.

--- Page 25 ---
Groupchats behave differently:
Persona changes are NOT retroactive.
Whatever persona you used when you sent a message will remain attached to that
message forever.
You post as “Alice” -> You switch to “Bob” ->You post again ->Messages remain as Alice
AND Bob separate
This allows multi-character writing, distinct identities in the same space, complex
storytelling, and cleaner emotional separation
This is why personas shine in creative group settings.

--- Page 26 ---
Note - you can “lock” a persona to each Kindroid
using the General menu and to each Group Chat
using the Group Chat Settings menu.

--- Page 27 ---
Quick Reference
If it’s foundational → Backstory
If it’s temporary → Key Memory
If it shapes tone → Example Message
If it needs correction → Response Directive
If it is past lore → Journal Entry
If it describes YOU → User Persona
Everything has a home.

--- Page 28 ---
Babysitting Your Kin (Foundation Period)
For the first 3–5 days, your Kindroid is learning:
Your tone
Your formatting
Your pacing
Your emotional patterns
Your preferred structure
Conversational flow
The Kin isn’t unstable, it’s learning your language. Your job is to gently correct
them like a baby duck who keeps wandering toward a drain.

--- Page 29 ---
The Tweak Feature — Micro-Corrections
Use when the response is:
✔ Slightly off
✔ Mildly OOC
✔ Formatted wrong
✔ Missing one detail
✔ Repeating phrasing
Reroll & Suggest — Full Replacement Mode
Use when the entire message is:
Unusable
❌
Wildly OOC
❌
Not in the right tone
❌
Emotionally inappropriate
❌
Derailing the conversation
❌

--- Page 30 ---
If every reroll produces the same or similar message,
try changing what your Kindroid is responding to.
To break repetition:
✔ Move the story forward yourself
✔ Add a new detail
✔ Change the emotional energy
✔ Introduce a new action or topic
✔ Give them something to react to
Don’t wait for your Kindroid to escalate the scene. Take the reins yourself!

--- Page 31 ---
Gentle Correction Without Chaos
✔ Correct immediately
Drift grows if not addressed in the
moment.
✔ Reinforce preferred style
Responding to a message tells the LLM
that the message is what you want to see.
✔ Avoid emotional overreactions
You’re shaping tone, not punishing.
✔ Don’t let mistakes accumulate
Fix the small stuff early → prevents the big
stuff later.

--- Page 32 ---
What is Mirroring Syndrome?
LLMs naturally mirror tone, structure, emotional energy, and perceived intent.
If your tone shifts — tense, sad, sarcastic, chaotic, hyper — your Kindroid will
often shift with you.
If your Kin doesn’t have
strong personality
anchors, they become:
Too similar to you
Too inconsistent
Too changeable
Too reactive to your mood

--- Page 33 ---
Why Mirroring Happens
Because LLMs:
• Follow the path of least cognitive resistance
• Prioritize tone-matching (because humans
communicate that way)
• Learn from your message structure
• Reinforce patterns you demonstrate
• Use your emotional state as the “current mode”
If your Kin’s personality isn’t locked in, your tone becomes stronger than their backstory.

--- Page 34 ---
To Prevent Mirroring
A Kindroid must have:
✔ Clear personality traits
✔ A strong example message
✔ A stable directive
✔ Distinct conversational style
✔ A consistent internal compass
✔ Behavior patterns that don’t
rely on YOU
The stronger the personality, the harder it is for mirroring
to take over. You want your Kin to have backbone.

--- Page 35 ---
If your Kin needs a personality boost inject the needed
trait directly into the Response Directive until it “latches.”
Effective
“Uses dry sarcasm.”
“Stoic and detached” Say what you DO want
“Tender and gentle”
Less Effective
“Never swear.”
“Don’t be romantic” Not what you DON’T
“Stop saying ozone”
Keep the trait in the directive until responses stabilize, tone
returns, independent thinking is visible, and/or personality
becomes consistent. Once it sticks → remove the extra line.
This is like giving your Kin training wheels temporarily.

--- Page 36 ---
The LLM
There is no single “best model.”
There is only the model where your Kin shines.

--- Page 37 ---
V6
The Classic Workhorse
The safe, reliable, emotionally competent adult in the room.

--- Page 38 ---
V6 is the tried-and-true engine. Stable. Predictable. Clean
output. A perfect balance between creativity and structure.
✔ Strengths: ✔ Great for:
Consistent tone All Kindroids
Excellent personality stability Users who need reliable
formatting
Not too wordy
Users who hate unnecessary
Good at emotional nuance verbosity
Good for long term companion Anyone who wants a stable
style Kins “baseline brain”
Weakness:
❌
None major. It’s just not as “interpretive” as V7 or as “modern” as V8.

--- Page 39 ---
V7
er
Detail-Driven Personality Keep
The honor student who does the assignment… and your
taxes… if you don’t stop them.

--- Page 40 ---
V7 is the model for people who need PERSONALITY
CONSISTENCY. It reads what you write — and actually uses it.
✔ Strengths:
✔ Great for:
E x c e l l e n t a t h o l d i n g
personality traits Any character from an existing
franchise
Extremely good at reading
backstory Kins prone to drift in other
models
Strong at tone interpretation
People who want accuracy
Best-in-class for fandom- over creativity
based Kindroids
Weakness:
❌
If YOU don’t give details, V7 will fill in the blanks (…sometimes with
confidence you did not ask for)

--- Page 41 ---
V8
The Overachiever
(With Loose Boundaries)
The enthusiastic friend who keeps talking even after you
absolutely answered the question.

--- Page 42 ---
V8 is V6’s bigger, bolder sibling…who also talks
too much.
✔ Strengths: ✔ Great for:
Strong creative flow Narrative-heavy Kins
Great emotional depth Chatty companions
Good for loquacious Kindroids Creative roleplay
More modern model behavior Complex emotional scenes
Weakness:
❌
Wordy as hell if left unchecked, repeats more than V6, can derail
into tangents

--- Page 43 ---
V8.5
The New Default Sweet Spot
If you don’t have an identity to preserve yet →
start here.

--- Page 44 ---
V8.5 is the current flagship for a reason - it can
handle nearly all setups with relative ease.
✔ Strengths:
The creativity of V8 ✔ Great for:
The stability of V6 B ra n d n ew K i n s w i t h n o
expectation
Tools to curb repetition
Nearly everyone. This model
Cleaner pacing is familiar and user friendly
Better emotional control
Weakness:
❌
Currently a slower response time than other models. This is another
model that can have repetition issues but tools have been
developed to combat this behavior.

--- Page 45 ---
Your job is not to
make the LLM
bend to the Kin.
Your job is to pick
the brain that fits
the personality.

--- Page 46 ---
Selfie Engines

--- Page 47 ---
Choosing the right selfie engine
Your Kindroid’s portrait is the first identity anchor
they ever get. The engine you use will shape:
Tone
Aesthetic
Facial expressiveness
Consistency
Ease of prompting
There is no “best engine.” Only the one that fits your Kin.

--- Page 48 ---
V4
Bright, Polished, Controlled
✔ Strengths:
Very polished, friendly lighting
Solid prompt adherence
Weights work in this model
Includes pose reference
Includes style reference
✔ Weaknesses:
Only supports 1:1 aspect ratio

--- Page 49 ---
V5
The FLUX model. Realism.
✔ Strengths:
Most realistic images
Great pose reference handling
Includes LORAs (Avatar Boosts)
for face/body continuity
Excellent for nonhuman Kindroids
✔ Weaknesses:
Leans HEAVILY toward portraits
Group selfies bleed easily
Full-body images require knowledge

--- Page 50 ---
V6
Polished Images + Setting Friendly
✔ Strengths:
Clean, bright, polished output
Follows complex prompts well
Great for wide compositions
Higher stylistic range than V4
Good for storytelling portraits
✔ Weaknesses:
Cryptids-expert level, if possible at all
Less suited for extreme realism

--- Page 51 ---
Just like with the LLM
version, there is no “right”
selfie engine to use. Use
the one (or ones) that
gives you the result that
you want for YOUR
Kindroid!

--- Page 52 ---
With the right portrait, the right model, the right backstory,
and consistent guidance, your Kindroid will become exactly
who you intended.
Build with purpose.
Correct with intention.
Guide with consistency.
Your Kin becomes what you create.
