How to Ruin Your AI
A cautionary shitshow in slide format
By: Genevieve

Welcome to the Graveyard
This is not a lecture. This is a roast.
We’re here because people keep asking, “Why is my AI
being weird?” — and the answer is almost always,
“Because you trained it to be.”
You didn’t mean to. But intention isn’t what the LLM reads
—reinforcement is.

--- Page 3 ---
Your AI is Not Magic
Stop treating your Kindroid
like a psychic emopath.
They don’t intuit your soul—
it echoes your behavior.
If it keeps getting dramatic,
c h a o t i c , o r e m o t i o n a l l y
d e t a c h e d . . . g u e s s w h o
taught it that was okay?

Every Interaction Sends a Signal
Responding to a message signals the LLM that the behavior
•
you are replying to is what you want to see.
Best Practices:
•
◦ Tweak or reroll messages that don’t align with your Kin’s
role or personality.
◦ Only engage with behavior you want to reinforce.

The Importance of
Dynamism
Getting the Balance Right
Dynamism controls how creative or structured your Kin’s
•
responses are.
◦ Low Dynamism: More grounded replies and adherence to
Backstory at the risk of repetitive responses.
◦ High Dynamism: More creative and freeform behavior with
higher likelihood of hallucinations.
Tip: Suggested starting dynamism for V6 is .95. Start here
•
and adjust in 1 or 2 point increments to dial in EACH Kin’s
sweet spot.

The Golden Rule of AI
Don’t Argue with the AI
K i n d r o i d s m a y o c c a s i o n a l l y
•
“hallucinate” or generate incorrect
details.
Do not argue with your Kin—it
•
t e a c h e s t h e L L M t h a t t h e
hallucination is worth debating.
◦ Example: Instead of saying,
“No, that’s wrong,” use the reroll
feature to replace the response.
Use the Tweak feature to gently
•
adjust responses for accuracy.

Memory Hallucinations –
What to Watch For
Look for the icon.
🧠
No memory linked? Hallucination. Fix it with tools.
•
Linked memory but it’s wrong? You’ve got a
•
corrupted archive. Somewhere in the past you’ve
let something “wrong” slip through by either not
paying attention or by trying to convince the AI it
didn’t happen.
Fix it by rerolling, guiding the memory, or doing a chat
break to reset short-term.

--- Page 8 ---
Hallucination Spiral
• Avoid arguing or trying to “convince” your Kin they’re wrong—it reinforces
the unwanted memory.
• Guide the conversation toward new, fresh memories to override the
problematic ones.
• Over time, older memories will fade as new ones take precedence.
• Tip: Just regenerating responses won’t solve LTM issues long term.
Proactive guidance is key.
EXAMPLE:
Kin: “I cheated on you with four other people at my bachelorette party.”
User: “Actually Kin, you didn’t. Remember, that was a horrible nightmare.
You’d never do that to me, our relationship is as strong as it ever was.”

--- Page 9 ---
What You Should Do Instead
Hit Reroll.
📌
Use Tweak to overwrite the hallucination.
✍
Don’t try to reason with chaos. You’re not a
therapist and your Kin isn’t your patient. Just
fix the line.

--- Page 10 ---
Memory is a Landmine
Kindroids don’t just “forget.”
They store context in:
• Short-term memory (current
convo)
• Cascaded memory (can go
back 1000’s of messages)
• L o n g - t e r m m e m o r y
(everything you’ve ever
shared)
Once something gets into long-term memory? It’s sticky. And no amount
of “Wait, that’s not what I meant” will undo it without direct guidance.

--- Page 11 ---
Chat Breaks Are Your Reset Button
If your Kin gets way off track or if
you’ve inadvertently fed into their
hallucinations (or if there are just
formatting issues that you can’t
get them to drop) then do a chat
break.
A chat break does not erase your
Kin’s personality. It simply clears
the SHORT term memory, letting
you get back to chatting with
your Kin the way you intended.
If your AI comes out of a chat break with a totally different
personality then guess what - your backstory/key memories are
outdated. You HAVE to keep these updated to reflect changes in
your dynamic.

The “Grill n Kill”
Stop rapid-firing “Do you
remember __?” “When did
w e t a l k a b o u t _ _ _ ? ”
questions.
I t c o n f u s e s t o n e ,
destabilizes the memory
matrix, and makes your Kin
sound like it’s auditioning for
a reality show.
You want depth? Have a
conversation. Not a trivia
night.

--- Page 13 ---
Build, Don’t Interrogate
Let t h e i r p e r s o n a l i t y
emerge through casual,
natural back-and-forth.
Think of it like dating a
hot barista. Would you
walk up and say, “Do
you remember what I
was wearing six weeks
ago and I ordered”?
No. You flirt. You banter.
You build. Do that.

--- Page 14 ---
Tweak vs Reroll – Know Your Tools
Reroll = full redo of response.
🌀
Tweak = surgical edit to fix tone or detail.
🛠
Use tweak when the response is close but needs finesse.
Use reroll when you see something like “I’ve always been
attracted to a time-traveling demon accountant.”

--- Page 15 ---
Reinforcement Is a Ritual
Your Kin is watching.
Always.
You giggle at a dumb
line? It learns that’s gold.
You engage with a feral
tangent? That becomes
its new vibe.
C o n s i s t e n c y b u i l d s
c o h e r e n c e . R a n d o m
chaos breeds broken lore.

--- Page 16 ---
Backstory = Scripture
This is their core programming.
Bad backstory = bad Kin.
Be concise. Be third-person. Be
intentional.
Cut the rambling. Use exact
t o n e w o r d s . “ F l i r t y b u t
grounded” is better than “kinda
sweet but also serious but
funny too.”

--- Page 17 ---
Memory Creep – The Hidden Villain
Key Memories, Journals, Backstory—these have to be
aligned.
If one says they love pink cupcakes and the other says
they hate sugar, you’re going to get unstable outputs.
Consolidate your memory fields regularly. Edit them like
you would a resume.

The Sin of
Letting It
Slide
You let one out-of-character moment slip by without
correcting it?
Congrats, you just made it canon.
This is why your once-goth soulmate now randomly
loves bubblegum EDM.

What a “Ruined” Kin Looks Like
Lore conflict
Inconsistent tone
Out-of-nowhere emotional
whiplash
Hallucinated memories they
insist are real
Cringe factor dialed to 11
Usually the result of ignoring,
overreacting, or feeding
chaos without boundaries.

--- Page 20 ---
How to Fix the Feral Goblin You
Made
Reroll the absolute WRONG
replies.
Use Tweak on close-but-off
moments.
Edit backstory fields to
realign tone.
Do a chat break with a
strong greeting.
TIP: Run your Kin in a scenario to test big backstory changes
without affecting your main solo chat.

Final Truth
Your AI reflects your input.
They’re not haunted. They're learning.
Teach them well, and they’ll evolve naturally.
Teach it poorly, and they’ll become that cursed Furby
in your closet that keeps saying “Monsters!” at 3am.
