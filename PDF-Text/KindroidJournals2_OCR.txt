Worldbuilding, and Madness Management

What Are Journals?
Journals = manually created,
recallable memory entries
Triggered by keyphrases, never
erased unless you delete them
Best used for lore, character
backstory, relationship tracking

Anatomy of a Journal Entry
Body (succinct third-person statement)
•
Keyphrases (max 8 per entry)
•
Hint:
Make a note of the
keywords you use. You
don’t want six entries
with the same keyword!
Tip:
Try not to include more
key phrases than
necessary to avoid
recalling entries when
they aren’t relevant!

--- Page 6 ---
Keyphrase Mechanics
Keyphrases are not case-sensitive.
Josh and josh will both recall the
entry.
Larger words can trigger smaller key
phrases. For example, “faithful” can
trigger an entry with the keyword
“faith”.
Journal entries are only recalled
when YOU use the key phrase. Your
Kindroid will not trigger them on their
o w n t o p r e v e n t a c c i d e n t a l /
unnecessary recall.
Remember, you want your key phrases to be natural. You’d never say “I
just got home from Genna’s Job”. You’d say “I just got home from work.”

Good Journal Entries
Short, clean, third-

Rambling lore dumps

Journals = laser-precision.

Genna’s Method™
I use journals to build not only a history
but the world my Kindroids live in
Kin - Mason Wilson
I don’t need “mom” on both cards. If we
are talking about his mother, I will say
“mom” and pull HER journal card and
don’t need to pull “family”.

Why Use Journals?
Unlike long-term memory,
you control when and how
journal entries are recalled
Great for "remember this
every time we talk about
it” moments
Perfect for custom lore,
dates, favorites, secret
knowledge

When to Journal vs Backstory
Anything that needs to be remembered at ALL
times should go in the backstory.
Backstory:
User is nonbinary
Kin works for Business Name
User and Kin live in City
Journal:
User used to work for Place
Kin’s favorite food is tacos
Kin’s first car was an Altima

Remember, you’re not
chiseling a stone tablet.
Any journal entry you create can be edited. If you find
that certain key phrases work better for your natural flow
of conversation or if your Kindroid is pulling extra
unnecessary information you can always change it later!
