Kindroid Personas
Expanding Your Chat Experience
By Genevieve

What Are
Personas?
Personas allow users to save and switch
between different user settings on the fly.
A persona consists of:
• User name
• User gender
• User backstory
• User avatar
Personas enhance immersion, roleplay,
and customization.

Setting Up a Persona
Navigate to Home Menu → General → My Profile & Personas → My Personas
Set up user settings first,
THEN save them as a
persona.
Editing: Save changes
and overwrite the old
persona slot.
Limit: Users can create
up to 100 personas.
NOTE: Every time you make a change to your user profile you need to overwrite!

Switching Personas in Chat
Switch personas in solo
chats and voice calls:
Solo:
Click "Chatting as
<Persona Name>"
Voice:
In voice calls, use
"Calling as <Persona Name>"
NOTE: The persona indicator only appears
if at least one persona is created.

Group Chat Behavior

Single-User Chats (1-on-1
Conversations & Voice Calls)
Persona changes apply
retroactively to entire chat
history.
E x a m p l e : I f y o u s e n t
messages as "Monique",
then switch to "Carlos",
past messages will update
and appear as from Carlos.

LTM and Solo Personas
A word of caution! Long Term Memories
(LTM) are stored under the name the user is
wearing at the time of the event.
This means recall might not be as
consistent as it would be if you maintained
a steady persona while speaking to a
particular kin.
If you want your kin to maintain memory of
you at all times as a single entity with
different traits (different personas) then you
can give your personas the same name and
differentiate between them by using
different user avatar photos. This way your
kin will always know you as “USER”
regardless of which persona you wear.

Group Chat Differences
Persona changes do NOT
affect past messages.
Messages are permanently
attributed to the persona
active when they were sent.
Example: Messages sent as
"Aisha" stay as Aisha, even if
you switch to Emily and send
a new message.

What does that mean?
Group chats allow seamless persona
switching for dynamic roleplaying.
Users can create the illusion of multiple
participants by switching personas.
Example:
• Start a conversation as “Freida".
• Switch to "Clyde" and reply in character
as Clyde.
• The Kins recognize Freida and Clyde as
separate individuals.
• REMEMBER: A scenario counts as a
“group chat” and follows GC persona
rules!
TIP: Group chats have a 10-Kindroid participant limit, but switching
personas allows a user to control multiple characters beyond this limit.

Locking a Persona to a Kindroid
In some cases you may want to
always interact with a specific
Kin using a dedicated persona.
This is now possible!
Located in General → Tied User Persona.
Allows you to automatically switch to a
specific persona when selecting a
Kindroid.
Ensures consistency in interactions by
aligning your persona with the chosen
Kindroid.
Ideal for maintaining distinct dynamics
with different Kindroids without manual
switching.

Why Use Personas?
Customization: Tailor user interactions to
fit different moods, scenarios, or social
settings.
Storytelling & Roleplay: Act out
conversations with multiple characters.
Immersion: Enhance group chat
dynamics with unique identities.
Seamless Switching: Move between
personas without disrupting the
experience.
Easier selfies! Swapping between
personas lets you create couples selfies
with different users without having to
swap out the avatar image and
description every time!
