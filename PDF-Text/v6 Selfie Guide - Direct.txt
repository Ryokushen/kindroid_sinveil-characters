## **What Changed in V6**

This new engine is built for **strong prompt adherence** and follows natural language closely.&#x20;

The following features are now deprecated: **pose references**, **style references, avatar boosts, negative prompts**, and **weighting syntax**. You no longer need to use them.  Describe the image in plain, direct language. The system now interprets natural descriptions accurately on its own.

It also produces **less automatic variation**, so repeating the same prompt will yield similar results. For more diversity, rewrite the prompt or enable the **Enhance Prompt Variety toggle&#x20;**&#x75;nder the image aspect ratio dropdown, which automatically introduces variation.

Prompt length is more limited than before, but the system still performs well with fewer words.
**Keep descriptions concise here; less truly does more.**

## **How to Write a Strong V6 Avatar Description (Most Important Step)**

Use this structure as your baseline template:

:::BlockQuote
Age:
Gender:
Ethnicity/Race:
Skin: (tone + texture details)
Hair: (length + style + color)
Eyes: (use “natural \_\_\_ eyes”)
Face: (shape, nose, lips, brows)
Build: (body type)
Details: (tattoos, scars, jewelry, piercings)
Style: detailed textures, soft cinematic lighting
:::

**Example:&#x20;**

Avatar Description

:::BlockQuote
A 24-year-old woman with pale skin and a soft natural flush, she has long wavy dark-brown hair threaded with caramel highlights, gentle features with a straight nose and full lips, and a curvy, toned build. She wears a small silver nose stud, shown in soft cinematic lighting.
:::

Face Detail

:::BlockQuote
Natural green eyes and slight freckles across her nose.
:::

**Why this matters**

V6 will follow this description **more strictly than any previous version.**
&#x20;If something is missing or vague here, autoselfies will drift.

- Keep everything **literal**.
  &#x20;No metaphorical marks (“star marking” will create a literal star).
- Use descriptors like **vascularity** for defined muscles.
- Add lighting cues inside avatar description if you want consistency.


## **How to Prompt in V6**

Since weights, negative prompts, wand, and pose refs are gone, V6 requires **straightforward description.**

### **Core Rule:**

Start with what matters most → move to scene → finish with style/lighting.

**Structure:**

1. Identity anchor (optional but useful)
2. Action / Pose
3. Setting
4. Clothing
5. Camera / Lighting / Mood

**Example:**

:::BlockQuote
\[Name] stands outdoors, facing the camera with a relaxed and natural expression.
They are wearing \[clothing description]. The environment around them shows \[background elements]. Lighting is \[type] and the image has \[texture/detail cues].
:::

### **Keep related details close together.**

&#x20;If you mention a campfire and smoke, phrase it like:

:::BlockQuote
&#x20;smoke rising from the campfire
:::

instead of separating the details across the prompt. 

### **Avoid these (deprecated or unsupported):**

- Any (weights:1.2) syntax.
- Negative prompts. “///” formats.

## **Generating Autoselfies in V6**

Before using autoselfies, follow this checklist:

### **Check your avatar description first.**

It now determines:

- face consistency
- skin tone
- hair shape
- overall realism
- stylistic cohesion

### **Expect lower variation.**

If two selfies feel similar:

- Enable **Enhance Prompt Variety**, which is a toggle underneath the image ratio drop-down.


## **Practical Prompting Tips for V6**

### **1. Describe the whole scene to avoid zoomed-in closeups.**

 If you want the model to “zoom out,” describe legs, shoes, and the background.

### **2. Use natural language intensity.**

Examples:

- “**extremely** detailed braid”
- “**very** soft natural lighting”
- “**subtle** freckles across the nose”

### **3. Use strong lighting cues.**

 Phrases like '**detailed textures**' and '**soft cinematic lighting**' are almost essential for avoiding flat or lifeless renders.

### **4. Group related ideas together.**

**Example:**

:::BlockQuote
A bonfire lighting the campsite, soft smoke drifting upward
:::

works far better than scattering those details into separate fragments.

### **5. For non-human characters**

Species must be declared first.
Details must be literal.
Avoid stylized metaphors unless you want artificial shapes.

## **Example V6 Selfie Prompt (Starter Template)**

You can adapt this as your universal starter:

:::BlockQuote
A natural candid selfie of \[Avatar Name] standing outdoors. They face the camera with a relaxed, genuine expression. They are wearing \[clothing description], and the background shows \[environment]. Lighting is soft and cinematic, highlighting natural textures in the skin and hair. The image feels like a real photo with detailed textures and clean realism.
:::

## **Example Prompt for More Variation&#xA0;**

:::BlockQuote
\[Avatar Name] takes a selfie at golden hour, the warm sunlight creating soft highlights on their face. They wear \[clothing], and behind them, the sky glows with fading orange light. The wind gently moves through their hair, and the camera captures a wide view of the scene. Cinematic lighting, clear background details, and natural depth give the photo a grounded realism.

## **When Something Goes Wrong in V6**

### Use this quick diagnostic:

| **Problem**                        | **Quick Fix**                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identity Drift                     | - Strengthen the avatar description with necessary details to improve accuracy, including skin texture and tone cues.
- Use the Face Detail section for all elements related to facial features (Photoreal) |
| Too zoomed in                      | * Add full-body clothing details
* Add surrounding scenery
* Add environment objects                                                                                                                        |
| Lighting looks flat                | Add explicit lighting details.<br />* Include phrases like “detailed textures” or “soft cinematic lighting” in the avatar description.                                                                      |
| Low variation                      | Rewrite the prompt, don’t tweak single words or enable the **Enhance Prompt Variety** toggle found under the image aspect ratio dropdown menu.                                                              |
| Glowing colored eyes/Blurred Faces | - Move eye color out of the AD (Photoreal only).
- Only specify eye color and face characteristics in Facial Detail.
- Instead of saying blue eyes, say blue irises.                                        |
